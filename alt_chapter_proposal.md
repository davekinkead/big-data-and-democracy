Democracies are, in principle at least, ruled by the people.  The legitimacy of a government's rule, and its' right to make and enforce laws over its citizens is derived from the very citizens it rules over. Yet this conception of democracy presupposes that a distinct _people_ exists, an 'us' to which we belong politically and a 'them' to which we don't.

A stable democracy requires a shared identity, culture, and language.  Its citizens need to identify as one _demos_ lest it fracture and balkanise.  What demarcates one demos from another then, is a function of the communication networks that connect the citizens of those _demoi_.  For the Greeks, their network was the Agora; for the Federalists, the newspaper; for us today, it is the internet. Until now, the physical nature of these communication networks has resulted in a trade off between the reach of a network and the ability to target and discriminate the content of a message on that network. 

One to one conversation in the Agora was highly targeted but could reach only as far as a voice could be heard.  As the printing press and later television allowed for greater and greater reach, the content of these networks became more generic. However, the internet and big data analtics have changed political communication forever, by decoupling network reach from message discrimination. This allows individually tailored content to be distributed on a global scale without fear that the content of those messages will be overheard by others. 

This chapter explores what impact this decoupling is having on democracy.  We show how social media and big data combine to create echo chambers of political discourse that undermine key assumptions underpinning epistemic justifications of democracy: specifically, the independence and competence assumptions of Condorcet's Jury Theorem, and the shared identity assumption of deliberative accounts.  We also offer some suggestions as to how the harms of this decoupling can be reduced.
