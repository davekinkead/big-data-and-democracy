This distinction between open and closed interactions corresponds with the distinction between broadcast and narrowcast messages.  Social media, therefore, offers a platform for sending narrowcast messages to a select audience with a global reach.

The accounts users follow serve to direct information of interest to the user.  In the terms of our earlier discussion of communication networks, social media are duplex communication networks with a negligible cost for broadcasting messages.  They have a global reach, but unlike the utopian pictures of Internet communication, they are centralised (as they required a social media network operator) and allow for narrowcast messages. The table below lists the characteristics of social media and the communication networks that preceded it.

|Medium       | Direction  | Reach          | Structure     | Cost    | Targeting  |
|--------     | ---------  | -------        | -----------   | ------  | -----------|
|Conversation | Duplex     | Interpersonal  | Decentralised | Minimal | Narrowcast |
|Agora        | Duplex     | Local          | Decentralised | Low     | Broadcast  |
|Print        | Simplex    | Regional       | Centralised   | Medium  | Broadcast  |
|Mass Media   | Simplex    | National       | Centralised   | High    | Broadcast  |
|Internet     | Multiplex  | Global         | Decentralised | Minimal | Broadcast  |
|Social Media | Multiplex  | Global         | Centralised   | Minimal | Narrowcast |


It is relatively straight-forward to hold individuals to account for face-to-face communication, since it is difficult to obscure one's identity in this context.  Liars and demagogues may be challenged directly by others.  As new communications technology emerged, it became easier to disguise the source of political messages. However, it also became more difficult to limit messages to a specific group within a broader audience.  There is an inherent trade-off between how narrowly the content of a message can be targeted at a specific group and how far that message can reach across a network.


  - Topologies can form many patterns.  they enable C&C
  - Autocratic topology - star shaped.
  - Democratic topologies: Rule by the people requires a particular pattern -- dense peer-to-peer.  

*- political networks are public networks. if it isnt connecting citizens, then it isn't political.  public sphere, shared understanding????*

*- a democratic network is one that has a dense peer to peer topology. cf autocratic networks that have certain nodes with communicative privilege.*

More autocratic _demoi_ have a political network that represents a star topology, where a central node (or nodes) has considerable connections to the other nodes. These are the rules of the _demos_. The regular citizens (the ruled) have few (if any) connections to other nodes. A political network with an simplified autocratic topology is shown in figure 1. The node at the centre of the diagram represents the ruler of the _demos_. It is the only node that is connected to all other nodes, and thus enjoys significant communicative privileges.

In contrast, democratic political networks have a topology where nodes have varying numbers of connections to other nodes.  

A political network with a democratic topology is shown in figure 2.  As the citizens are both rulers and ruled (in the democratic sense that they have some influence in political decisions and are also bound by them), they have the means and opportunity to communicate with each other about political matters.


> Stable democracies also require political norms of _mutual toleration_ and _institutional forbearance_ [@levitsky_how_2018, pp. 102-106].  Mutual toleration requires citizens to recognise each other as political equals regardless of political differences.  Political opponents are rivals rather than criminals or existential threats to the _demos_.  Institutional forbearance is the norm that those with political power respect the spirit of law and regulation rather use the letter of the law or exploit loopholes in it to undermine political opponents and democratic process. 

-- not sure about this para above ^^^. I think we should kill it.

The third corrupting factor, apathy, weakens democracy by discouraging interest and participation in politics.  As a result, those who vote or otherwise influence political decisions are less representative of the entire society.  The lack of interest in politics by sections of the community may be exploited by others to allow political inequalities to continue or expand at the expense of the apathetic. 

Unlike Plato, we make no important distinction between sophistry and demagoguery as one can use clever but fallacious arguments to exploit an audience's ignorance and prejudices.  As such, we will use the terms interchangeably.


This is a form of the public sphere identified by Habermas [@benkler_wealth_2006, p. 177].

  - Democracy can be corrupted by demagogy (exploiting prejudice and ignorance), sophistry (clever but fallacious), and apathy (preventing people from caring) @dd

The medium may be speech, text printed in a book or pamphlet, sound, images, and video transmitted by mass media. 

The medium affects how quickly a message is conveyed and to how many people can receive it.  A whispered conversation has a narrow and targeted audience, with the source and receiver speaking to each other face-to-face.  A television broadcast potentially has an audience of millions.  As this example suggests, different communication media have different levels of accessibility to citizens: anyone capable of hearing and speech can engage in a whispered discussion with another, but a television broadcast requires airtime on a television network.  The cost of using the medium to communicate with the desired audience affects how accessible it is to each citizen.

Each individual citizen in the _demos_ is represented by a node in the political network.  The connections between the nodes represent a communication medium that allows those nodes to exchange messages.  These connections may be bidirectional if each node may communicate with the other in the same medium, or unidirectional if only one node may send a message to the other via that medium.  Unidirectional connections mean that the node receiving the message cannot respond with a similar message in the same context within the same communication medium.  Consider a speaker at a political rally: the crowd may respond with cheers or jeers, but the individuals in the crowd lack the privileges granted by standing on the podium and expressing their views to the audience.  The crowd cannot engage in an equal political discussion with the speaker in this context.  Unidirectional communication therefore grants the source *communicative privilege*, as her audience (as individuals) do not have the same opportunity to present their message to both the source and to the rest of the audience in the same way.

In contrast, bidirectional communication occurs when nodes can respond to the messages in the same communication medium.  Interpersonal communication is bidirectional, while the characteristics of different forms of technologically mediated communication determine whether it is unidirectional or bidirectional.  The form of technology used to communicate hence affects how political communication takes place and who is communicatively privileged over others in distributing their messages.  Different communication technologies allow for different connections to exist between nodes.  Individuals who are geographically distant from each other will lack a face-to-face connection, although a connection may exist via other communication media, such as letters, printed material, and mass media.  The possible connections across a variety of communication media also depend on the resources available to individuals.  Wealthy individuals are able to communicate with many more other citizens than poorer ones as they have access to a great range of communication media.  The wealthy are, quite literally, better connected than their less fortunate peers.

*- narrow cast in Athens*

Public life in ancient Athens is represented by the *agora* (marketplace) [@habermas_structural_1989, p. 3].  The face-to-face communication of the *agora* allows speakers to target different audiences.  You could shout and be heard by all (making it a public message), or you could whisper and be heard by one (making it private).  The audience may be active by directly engaging publicly or privately with speakers in debate, or passive by only listening to the speaker's messages. Face-to-face, interpersonal communications are *narrowcast* political messages, as they are restricted to a specific intended audience.

- how it is at risk
- why democracy is robust to this risk
  - linkage between reach and discrimination
  - independent media -> independent reasoning
- how big data erodes this robustness



# How the fragemented networks effect the necessary conditions of epistemic justifications of democracy


## Democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others we've tried from time to time.

1. Democracy has real epistemic value

  - it has value - fairness, justice, equality, knowledge
  - Democracy answers the question: when we need to make collective decisions but which decision is better?
  - these epistemic accounts of democracy can be purely aggregative (eg CJT, wisdom of the crowds) or transformative (eg Deliberative)
  - aggregative accounts rely on diverse perspective and reasoning processes (voter independence) to aggregate the marginal competence of large numbers of people into majority decisions that have a high likelihood of being correct. 
  - deliberative accounts rely on diverse persepective and reasoning processes to transform reasoned and authentic deliberation into broad consensus about superior outcomes.


2. This epistemic value is always at risk

  - self interest can lead to subversion of democracy for private ends
  - Democracy can be corrupted by demogogy, sophistry, and indifference
  - sophistry expliots the psychological disconnect between what people do believe and what people should believe
  - increasing voter turnout amongst protagnonistic voters
  - suppressing voter turnout amongst antagonistic voters
  - shifting voter preference amongst undecided voters
  - undermining confidence in the legitimacy of democratic outcomes


4. The Network and the Demos 

  - Democratic proceedures can be viewed as a socio-political response to problems of collective judgement.
  - All epistemic accounts of democracy presuppose some group of people who make up the democracy and a method of communication amongst them
  - across these networks, there was a trade off between how far a signal could reach and how much the content could be discriminated between individuals
  - whilst sophistry was possible, it came with a cost - reputational damage, backfire when called out
  - high discrimination communication permitted low cost sophistry but had limited reach
  - high reach communication had low discrimination meaning sophistry could only be general in nature.
  - high reach communication required more resources and could be regulated, increasing the cost of sophistry


  - athens: high discrimination, low reach, low production cost, low repuation cost
  - federalists: low discrimination

Big Data and Democracy

  - the confluence of big data & social media platforms has decoupled the link between communication reach and cost.



3. How: Psychology of sophistry

  - different groups of voters have differing psychological profiles
  - motivated reasoning
  - confirmation bias
  - substitution 



2. Methods of propoganda

  - hyper targeted attack ads
  - propaganda hidden as fake events from fake accounts (followed by users or promoted)
  - tweets of misinformation from fake supporting accounts attempting to suppress voters (save time, vote via twitter) 





# The Network is the Demos


Attributes of communication networks

  - democracy as communication
  - power and pursuasion (asymetry, production cost)
  - how we pursuade
  - message reach (1 to 1, vs 1 to many, many to many, few to few)
  - message discrimination (persistent vs ephemeral)
  - message direction
  - message source ??? (hidden via trolls)


The Historical Account

  - history of democracy from the perspective of media networks
  - Athenians (agora, symmetric active & passive participation, local demos)
  - federalists (newspaper, asymmetric favouring active participants, regional demos)
  - 1920's (radio, more asymemetric to active, national demos)
  - mass media (tv, huge asymmetry to active, very broad demos)


# Individualised Media fragements the Demos

Demonstrate how new media fragments traditional mass media networks
^[DD: Need to define media fragments: perhaps 'news presented devoid of context and quality signifiers'?]

  - how does the internet fragment our comms networks?
  - distinction between following blogs/producers & SM news feed
  - individualised media (internet, massive centralisation, decoupling of message discrimination)
  - how much of our attention is drawn to walled gardens
  - cf mass media ownership laws
  - individual responses in SM are not public in the traditional sense (the appropriation of public comms space)
  - "the algorithm is appropriating the agora"




  1. Hyper-targeted political advertising (Cambridge Analytics)
  2. Curation algorithms (Google search, FB news feed)

  - Condorcet Jury Theorems
    - echo chamber undermines the competence condition but not the independence if we ignore psych data 
    - if we accept that group think occurs, then it also undermines the independence claim
  - Epistemic Proceduralism
  - Deliberative Democracy


# Prescriptive section

  - ???


## Democracy and Demagoguery 

  - democracy has epistemic value
    - CJT
    - DD
  - that value is constantly at risk
    - plato's demogoguery
    - mechanism
      - emotion is substituted for reason
      - convert fears & anieties into voting behaviour 
    - limits
      - partisanship limits persuadability
      - can still limit or enhance predispositions

## The Network and the Demos

  - Network structures have traditionally made democracies epistemically robust
  - network structures impose a trade off between message reach and discrimination
    - as reach increases, discrimination and response decreases
    - Agora - shifting discourse from reason to rheotric requires appealing to specifics

    - we can influence more and more people, but our capacity to manipulate diminishes
    - Federalists - anonymity allows 
    - increased diversity increases epistemic value and makes manipulation harder


## Big Data and Democracy

  - The internet has made democracy frigile
  - the net decouples reach and discrimination
    - enables two way communication at scale (unidirection to bidirectional)
    - significantly increases the communication analytics able to be captured (ratings vs individual actions)
    - big data analytics allows the construction of accurate psychographic models for much of the population
    - ML can automatic the creation of content for particular effects



Facebook
  - has digitally enclosed the public forum (discourse is no longer public but now a web of private conversations)
  - the echo chamber effect lowers epistemic virtue by limiting

Twitter
