Thesis: The nature of communication networks provided democracy with epistemic robustness.  Big data and social media are now eroding this robustness.

## Act I

1. Democracy is valuable but imperfect

2. There are numerous accounts for why democracy is valuable including fairness, justice, equality, knowledge

3. One important source of value is epistemic (see rousseau, mill, cohen, habermas, CJT)

4. Epistemic justifications must overcome significant challenges (its foibles)

    - knowledge deficiencies: voters lack the necessary knowledge & expertise to make informed judgements accross a wide range of issues

    - cognative biases: all humans suffer from faulty reasoning to some degree

    - divergent values: all humans hold a range of diverse values (we are biased to our own point of view)

5. Epistemic democracy overcomes these challenges (and can turn them into positives)

    - highlight the importance of cognative diversity & explain the mechanism of how this works
      - CJT
      - Wisdom of the crowds
      - Scientific practice
  - divergent view points are essential to the strengh of aggregative accounts
  - bandwagon effect can be positive when the process is truth tracking

6. Further complications arise when participants are not commited democrats (its saboteurs)

  - self interest can lead to subversion of democracy for private ends
    - see Habermas' "systemically distorted communication" in Knowledge and Human Interests

  - Democracy can be corrupted by demogogy, sophistry, and indifference
  
  - sophistry expliots the psychological disconnect between what people do believe and what people should believe

  - anonymity can be used to mask sophist intent
  
  - increasing voter turnout amongst protagnonistic voters
  
  - suppressing voter turnout amongst antagonistic voters
  
  - shifting voter preference amongst undecided voters
  
  - undermining confidence in the legitimacy of democratic outcomes


## Act 2

4. The nature of communication networks keep democracy epistemically robust 

  - Habermas' democratic institutions as communication networks connecting private individuals (citizens) with collective identities (citizenship)
    - the public sphere is only public if we all participate (as consumers or producers)

  - A technological feature of traditional communication networks is the couipling of the reach of a message (geographically, audience), cost, and content discrimination

  - Athenians (agora, symmetric active & passive participation, local demos)
    - choice between 1-1 private comms or public comms
    - ?? how is democracy corrupted here ?? plato?? 
    - large scale sophistry was technoligically difficult
      - low cost comms but limited reach

  - Federalists (newspaper, asymmetric favouring active participants, regional demos)
    - increase range, increased cost, decreased discrimination
    - ?? role of anonymity in federalist papers
    
  - Mad Men (mass media, tv, huge asymmetry to active, very broad demos)
    - increase range, increased cost, decreased discrimination further
    - responses: broadcast licenses, FCC fairness doctrine, media ownership laws


## Act 3

5. Big data and social media decouple the traditional communications trade off

  - early utopian hopes of a positive decoupling of reach from cost

  - emergency of walled gardens & network effects decoupled reach and discrimination instead

  - caputre of public forums by private mediums
    - challenges to regulation
    - cost free sophistry

  - big data permits generation of psychographic models to exploit cognative biases (erodes voter competence)
    - sophistry is more effective

6. Aftermath:
