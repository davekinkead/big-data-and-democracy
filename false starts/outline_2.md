Thesis: The nature of communication networks provided democracy with epistemic robustness.  Big data and social media are now eroding this robustness.

## Act I

1. Democracy is valuable but imperfect

  - churchill's trope
  
  - why is it valuable? - fairness, justice, equality, knowledge
  
  - epistemic justifications
  
  - condorcet's jury theorm
    - quick review of lit
    - relies on 1) voter independence & 2) voter competence

  - deliberative accounts
    - rousseau, mill, cohen, habermas
    - relies on ??? power distribution, common goal / commitment to reason, diverse views

2. Epistemic justifications must overcome significant challenges (its foibles)

  - the challenge of epistemic democracy is generate superior answers despite:

    1. knowledge deficiencies: voters lack the necessary knowledge & expertise to make informed judgements accross a wide range of issues

    2. cognative biases: all humans suffer from faulty reasoning to some degree

    3. divergent values: all humans hold a range of diverse values (we are biased to our own point of view)

  - despite these challenges, epistemic democracy does overcome them and in the case of 3 and sometimes 2, turns them into positives

  - divergent view points are essential to the strengh of aggregative accounts
  
  - bandwagon effect can be positive when the process is truth tracking

3. Further complications arise when participants are not commited democrats (its saboteurs)

  - self interest can lead to subversion of democracy for private ends
    - see Habermas' "systemically distorted communication" in Knowledge and Human Interests

  - Democracy can be corrupted by demogogy, sophistry, and indifference
  
  - sophistry expliots the psychological disconnect between what people do believe and what people should believe
  
  - increasing voter turnout amongst protagnonistic voters
  
  - suppressing voter turnout amongst antagonistic voters
  
  - shifting voter preference amongst undecided voters
  
  - undermining confidence in the legitimacy of democratic outcomes

## Act 2

4. The nature of communication networks keep democracy epistemically robust 

  - Habermas' democratic institutions as communication networks connecting private individuals (citizens) with collective identities (citizenship)
    - the public sphere is only public if we all participate (as consumers or producers)

  - A technological feature of traditional communication networks is the trade off between the reach of a message (geographically, audience) and content discrimination

  - Athenians (agora, symmetric active & passive participation, local demos)
    - choice between 1-1 private comms or public comms
    - ?? how is democracy corrupted here ?? plato?? 

  - Federalists (newspaper, asymmetric favouring active participants, regional demos)
    - increase range, increased cost, decreased 
    
  - Mad Men (mass media, tv, huge asymmetry to active, very broad demos)

## Act 3

5. Big data and social media decouple the traditional communications trade off
