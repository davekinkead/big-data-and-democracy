## Democracy and Demagoguery 
(In which we highlight the epistemic risk to democracy)

Plato is infamous for his disdain of democracy.  Like being ruled by jury of children, democracy erodes reason by suffocating the voice of wisdom in a cloud of ignorance.  Like a ship at sea, the state needs specialist knowledge and skill - the keen eye of the navigator and the calm hand of an experienced captain - to steer it through troubled waters.

Decisions made by an unskilled and uniformed _demos_ will always be inferior to those of philosopher-monarchs.  Democratic policy will be determined by base desire rather than reason.  A state ruled by the people will inevitably succumb to the siren's song of a persuasive orator whose lust for power and manipulation of the masses can only result in tyranny.

To rule well, one must have expertise, knowledge, and wisdom. It is obvious then that the decisions of an _episitocracy_ should be superior to the decisions of a _democracy_.

2000 years later, the polymath Sir Francis Galton harboured similar thoughts about decision making.  Until that is, he calculated the results of 787 bets on the estimated weight of an ox at a country fair and discovered that the median result of the _vox populi_ was within 0.8% of the actual weight (@galton1907).

This result highlights the intriguing epistemic value of collective decision making involving disparate actors - that whenever people of diverse cognitive ability reason collectively in a setting that rewards truth tracking, the collective judgment will be, probabilistically at least, superior to the judgment of any one individual.

The superior epistemic value of collective reasoning is a theme found across a variety of disciplines.  In economics, @hayek1945 championed the superiority of free-markets over centrally planned economies where free individual actors informed by price signals can better allocate resources than a central committee, despite no one actor having a comprehensive understanding of the economy.  In science, @kitcher1990 ....  

Sometimes dubbed the _wisdom of the crowds_ (@cite), these approaches to collective decision making have recently manifested in prediction markets ...

Democracy, of course, is no stranger to this epistemic theme.  Whilst Plato may have prefered epistocracy to democracy, enlightenment scholars were embracing democracy's epistemic power.  

Rousseau thought that individuals stating their opinion on a matter by voting would elicit the general will of the people, a general opinion that would be superior than one's own @rousseau1762

Mill "QUOTE" as did Dewey "QUOTE" ...

The epistemic value of democratic decision procedures is all the more surprising given limitations and differences of the individuals themselves.  Plato's premise was correct -- the average voter is ignorant and uninformed.

  - survey voter ignorance lit ... @downs1957, @caplin1999, @caplin2007, @somin2008

Compounding this further is the inherently flawed nature of human reasoning.  Much of our reasoning and judgment processes are based on simple heuristics that occasionally manifest as cognitive biases.   We all suffer from a range cognitive biases that transcend age, culture, and education level (@cite).  

We frequently engage in motivated reasoning ....

Our decisions are strongly influenced by the order that information is presented in (framing @tversky1981)

  - anchoring
  - representational heuristic
  - availability heuristic

Even if all citizens were fully rational and completely informed, we would still suffer from a _demos_ that holds a wide range of values and disparate views on what the 'best' choice might be. ....

Yet democracy seems to overcome these challenges and can turn them into positives.

  - highlight the importance of cognitive diversity & explain the mechanism of how this works
    - CJT
    - Deliberative models

- divergent view points are essential to the strength of aggregative accounts

  - bandwagon effect can be positive when the process is truth tracking

Further complications can arise however, when the participants of a democracy are not committed to the democratic process. 

  - key claim: people can manipulate others into reasoning poorly in order to subvert the truth (and therefore epistemic democracy) for personal gain ....

  - self interest can lead to subversion of democracy for private ends
    - see Habermas' "systemically distorted communication" in Knowledge and Human Interests

  - Democracy can be corrupted by demagogy (exploiting prejudice and ignorance), sophistry (clever but fallacious), and indifference (preventing people from caring)
  
  - sophistry exploits the psychological disconnect between what people do believe and what people should believe

  - anonymity can be used to mask sophist intent
  
  - increasing voter turnout amongst protagonistic voters
  
  - suppressing voter turnout amongst antagonistic voters
  
  - shifting voter preference amongst undecided voters
  
  - undermining confidence in the legitimacy of democratic outcomes


## The Network and the Demos

Thankfully democracy has more up its sleeve. Democracy requires communication and it is the nature of communication networks keep democracy epistemically robust.

Habermas characterises democratic institutions as mediated communication networks connecting private individuals (citizens) with their collective identities (citizenship) (@cite).  These

Early democracies were relatively small affairs by modern standards, both geographically and demographically.  The fledging democracy of ancient Athens, for example, was a city-state, although one that would gain and lose power across the Greek peninsula. The geographical range of political discussion did not have to extend far beyond the city (if it had to at all). The citizenry of Athens was familiarly limited. Athens restricted citizenship to free people whose parents themselves were Athenian citizens, and only men could vote and participate in political life [@aristotle_athenian_1984, L.42].  The council of five hundred (all chosen by lot from the citizenry) would vote on the issues facing the city and on whether they had confidence in the office holders [@aristotle_athenian_1984, M.43].  This close connection between citizenship and political participation meant that political discussion was an integral part of Athenian life.

Public life in ancient Athens (and that of ancient Greece generally) is represented by the *agora* (marketplace) [@habermas_structural_1989, p. 3].  The face-to-face communication of the *agora* allows speakers to target different audiences.  You could shout and be heard by all (making it a public message), or you could whisper and be heard by one (making it private).  The audience may be active by directly engaging publicly or privately with speakers in debate, or passive by only listening to the speaker's messages.  This ability to actively engage with speakers in front of the same audience made political communication in the *agora* symmetrical.

If communication remains face-to-face, messages can only propagate beyond the original audience by audience members relaying them to others, either face-to-face or via written communication.  Face-to-face messages are *ephemeral*, as the only evidence of the message's content is the recollection of those involved.  These recollections themselves may be changed for political purposes, and they may even deny that such communication occurred.  If a written record is made of a political speech, the message becomes *static*.  A static message also has a greater range than an ephemeral one, as it exists in a physical, accessible form that can be read, transported, and copied after the message was first sent.  Consider the famous speeches of the Athenian orator Demosthenes as an example. The orations themselves are ephemeral, and transmit his message directly to his audience face-to-face.  Written records of these speeches, either by Demosthenes himself or audience members, place the message in a static form that may be communicated to those who were not present when the speech was given.  The written accounts of these speeches have a greater range than the original speech itself.  Static messages are more difficult to change to suit different audiences for political purposes.

The ancient Athenians recognised that not political messages were equal.  In *Gorgias* (454e), Plato distinguishes between persuasion that gives knowledge to the audience, and persuasion that convinces the audience without providing them knowledge.  The first type of persuasion we will call reasoned discussion, as the discussion aims to demonstrate to the audience that if they accept a set of beliefs or facts about the world, they must logically accept the conclusion the speaker is arguing for.  Political discussions of this nature revolve around debating the truth or falsity of the statements within the argument, and whether the conclusion (the political act being argued for) necessarily follows from the presented argument.  Ideally, reasoned political discussion should allow those who disagree to understand each other's positions, to identify the specific points of disagreement between them, and whether agreement can be reached.  Political discussions of this form open up political arguments to critique and examination.  This is the _reasoned_ political discussion that democracy needs to operate effectively.

The other form of persuasion does not inform the audience in the same way.  In the *Gorgias*, Plato's Socrates presses the claim against the orator Gorgias that a good orator can be more persuasive to those without expert knowledge of a subject than an expert (459b).  As a result, a skilled communicator can be persuasive without necessarily being knowledgeable.  If the audience is not well educated about the subject under debate, they may be persuaded to accept a conclusion that does not depend on the truth of its statements or the logic of the arguments presented to convince its audience.  What is important for this form of persuasion is that the audience accepts the conclusion, not that the argument is justified by the facts or logical structure.  In the *Sophist* (267b-c), Plato goes on to distinguish between *sophistry*, the acts of "us[ing] short speeches in private conversation to force the person talking with him to contradict himself", and the speeches of a demagogue, who "can maintain his insincerity in long speeches to a crowd".  Both forms of persuasion risk undermining reasoned political discussion.

Democracy later reemerged in North America after the British colonies there declared independence in 1776 and successfully rebelled against Great Britain.  Public political discussion played a crucial role in determining how the colonies would govern themselves and the political union between them.  The emergence of privately operated printing presses also allowed for a greater range of political messages to be produced and distributed, even if they were critical of the state [@benkler_wealth_2006, p. 186].  The Federalist Papers, a series of articles appearing in New York newspapers by 'Publius' (a pseudonym shared by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay), is an influential example of political discussion from this period.  These articles are significant for our discussion for two reasons: the depth and care with which they discuss political issues, and that they were part of a debate with opposing views that were also in print.  The Federalist Papers were a response to newspaper articles in support of rejecting the proposed Constitution (@kramnick_federalist_1987, p. 76).^[Proponents of the draft Constitution and the central federal government it would establish were known as Federalists; their opponents were hence Anti-Federalists [@kramnick_federalist_1987, p. 37].]  This demonstrates the possibilities of this form of political discussion.  Pamphlets and newspapers may serve as bidirectional communication, as individuals who disagree may respond with political messages of their own in the same medium.  Face-to-face communication, such as that in the Athenian *agora*, is bidirectional, but of course its reach and range is limited by the physical proximity to their audience.  The bidirectional communication printing made possible allowed for political discussion to occur across larger geographical areas and before a greater audience.

Unlike face-to-face communication, the political discussions of the Federalists or their opponents could not be easily tailored to suit particular audiences: their arguments were available to all who could read the newspapers printing them.  As the Federalist Papers themselves demonstrate, the arguments were visible to political opponents who could respond in kind, if there were printers or newspapers willing to print them. While the use of pseudonyms in publishing static messages allows the messages to be tailored (since it allows an author to present different views under different names, to disguise their common source and without having to be consistent between them), in this case no such deception was intended: the views presented by Madison, Hamilton, and Jay as 'Publius' did not conflict with their public support for the Constitution.  Pseudonyms or anonymity in presenting a political message may be used for rhetorical purposes (such as the reference to the Roman Republic that 'Publius' signalled [@kramnick_federalist_1987, p. 72].) or to prevent the message's reception being influenced by any bias (positive or negative) that may result from it being attributed to a particular individual or group.

While the newspapers and pamphlets increased the reach of political messages, it also increased the asymmetry between the sources and recipents of these messages. The readers of newspapers and political pamplhets are largely a passive audience, unless they themselves have their political messages printed as well.  The range and distribution of newspapers also began to change as industrialisation increased the economies of scale of newspaper printing [@benkler_wealth_2006, p. 187].  Smaller, local newspapers found it more difficult to compete with cheaper, mass produced newspapers with larger geographical audiences.  Selling advertising space also became more important for funding the increasing costs of operating newspapers [@benkler_wealth_2006, p. 188].  This asymmetry between active speakers and large, passive, and geographically dispersed audiences, was further intensified by the development of radio and television in the 20th centry.

Radio and television allowed messages to be broadcast across a geographical range unmatched by messages conveyed via earlier technologies.  The unidirectional communication of these mass media networks from transmitters to passive receivers also makes them vulnerable to centralised control [@benkler_2006, p. 196].  Radio television allowed governments and heads of state to address their entire population instantly.  These messages are broadcast to the population, making them accessible to all with the technology necessary to receive them.  As a result, the message's audience is the entire population, rather than specific sections of it.  Messages conveyed via mass media are *broadcast*, where messages are received by those disinterested, neutral, or hostile to the message, as well as the intended audience [@lilleker_key_2006, pp. 46--48].  

Mass media also marks the point where public political discussion in democracies became more *unidirectional*: the audience cannot respond with their own messages in the same medium.  Unidirectional communication gives the speaker power, as her audience do not have the same privilege to present their own message to both the source and the rest of the audience in the same way.  Similarly, the operators of mass media broadcast networks have power over their audience as they decide which speakers appear on their broadcasts and whether they are presented favourably or otherwise.   

In contrast, messages conveyed to a specific intended audience are *narrowcast* messages.  As Lilleker [-@lilleker_key_2006, p. 48] rightly observes, narrowcast messages are insecure in that they may still be received by those outside of the targeted audience, or it may be passed onto and reported by the media.^[Lilleker [-@lilleker_key_2006, p. 48] illustrates this point with the example of the Canadian Liberal Party sending cards to different groups of voters that contained opposing campaign pledges.]  If narrowcast messages are made more secure, however, then the chances of their claims being disputed by others decreases.  If the targeted audience is predisposed to accept claims that others might reject as erroneous, that audience is less likely to be critical of the arguments presented to them.

This brief survey of communication networks, from the face-face communication of the Athenian *agora* to the television broadcasts of the 20th century, suggests an inverse relationship between the *reach* and *discrimination* of political messages.  A speaker in the *agora* can choose her audience by speaking to a select few in secret or to the entire assembly. However, who she may speak to is limited by the need to be face-to-face with her audience.  To reach a wider audience, she must commit her messages to a static form in writing.  In doing so, she loses some ability to choose who receives her message: such messages become less secure. Her audience can also directly respond to her messages with messages of their own, so the audience can be active participants in political debate. As new technologies emerged, as the printing press, radio, and television, the potential reach of political messages increased.  The size and geographical range of the political audience increased, at the cost of increasing the asymmetry between the speaker and the audience.  The static form of printed and broadcast messages also made it more difficult to ensure that political messages only reached a specific section within the audience.  Speakers were less able to be discriminate in their audience.  It also became more difficult for the audience to be active in political debate with speakers, as they increasingly received political messages in unidirectional forms.  Mass media communication networks allowed for political messages to reach national and international audiences, at the cost of limiting the speaker's ability to securely convey different messages to different groups.  It is this trade-off between reach and discrimination that is challenged by the Internet, and especially by the use of big data analytics to identify specific groups within the citizenry.
