Thesis: The nature of communication networks provided democracy with epistemic robustness.  Big data and social media are now eroding this robustness.

## Act I - Democracy and Demagoguery

1. Collective decision making has a surprisingly powerful epistemic value.

Plato is infamous for his disdain of democracy.  Like being ruled by a jury of children, democracy erodes reason by suffocating the voice of wisdom in a cloud of ignorance.  Like a ship at sea, the state needs specialist knowledge and skill - the keen eye of the navigator and the calm hand of an experienced captain - to steer it through troubled waters.

Decisions made by an unskilled and uniformed _demos_ will always be inferior to those of philosopher-monarchs.  Democratic policy will be determined by base desire rather than reason.  A state ruled by the people will inevitably succumb to the siren's song of a persuasive orator whose lust for power and manipulation of the masses can only result in tyranny.

To rule well, one must have expertise, knowledge, and wisdom. It is obvious then that the decisions of an _episitocracy_ should be superior to the decisions of a _democracy_.

2000 years later, the polymath Sir Francis Galton harboured similar thoughts about decision making.  Until that is, he calculated the results of 787 bets on the estimated weight of an ox at a country fair and discovered that the median result of the _vox populi_ was within 0.8% of the actual weight (@galton1907).

This result highlights the intriguing epistemic value of collective decision making involving disparate actors - that whenever people of diverse cognitive ability reason collectively in a setting that rewards truth tracking, the collective judgment will be, probabilistically at least, superior to the judgment of any one individual.

The superior epistemic value of collective reasoning is a theme found across a variety of disciplines.  In economics, @hayek1945 championed the superiority of free-markets over centrally planned economies where free individual actors informed by price signals can better allocate resources than a central committee, despite no one actor having a comprehensive understanding of the economy.  

In science, @kitcher1990 demonstrated how individual cognitive diversity improves collective knowledge when we don't know the truth ahead of time.  Sometimes dubbed the _wisdom of the crowds_ (@cite), these approaches to collective decision making have recently manifested as prediction markets for intelligence analysis (@cia) and data science out sourcing (@kaggle)

2. Democracy can be viewed as a type of collective decision making

Democracy, of course, is no stranger to this epistemic theme.  Whilst Plato may have preferred epistocracy to democracy, enlightenment scholars were embracing democracy's epistemic power.  Rousseau thought that individuals stating their opinion on a matter by voting would elicit the general will of the people, a general opinion that would be superior than one's own (@rousseau1762). 

Mill "QUOTE" as did Dewey "QUOTE" ... 

These _epistemic_ justifications of democracy have seen a resurgence in contemporary political theory in a range of accounts such as public reason (@rawls), deliberative democracy (@habermas), and procedural accounts (@list, @estlund).  Despite their diversity in _how_ they justify democratic legitimacy, epistemic accounts are united in their claim that democratic processes are better, on average at least, at tracking the truth on particular matters than any one individual is. 

3. Democracy's epistemic value is surprising given the cognitive foibles of the individuals involved

  - the problem of voter ignorance
  - cognitive flaws of human reasoning
  - diverse values of liberal societies

- Democratic processes overcome these foibles to produce superior epistemic value.

  - cjt only requires average voter competence of +50%
  - robust public debate identifies which choices are superior and why
  - social cognition overcomes many individual biases (myside myopia) 
  - public reason liberalism offers one solution to diverse values

- This presupposes a commitment to the truth by voters. Bad actors can still subvert democracy.

  - self interest can lead to subversion of democracy for private ends
    - see Habermas' "systemically distorted communication" in Knowledge and Human Interests

  - political manipulation exploits the psychological disconnect between what people do believe and what people should believe

  - Democracy can be corrupted by demagogy (exploiting prejudice and ignorance), sophistry (clever but fallacious), and apathy (preventing people from caring)

    - example demagogy
    - example sophistry
    - example apathy

- Bad actors need not change peoples from antagonists to protagonists

  - increasing voter turnout amongst protagonistic voters
  - suppressing voter turnout amongst antagonistic voters
  - shifting voter preference amongst undecided voters
  - undermining confidence in the legitimacy of democratic outcomes
    - both foreign powers and oligarchs


## Act II - The Network & The Demos

- The network defines the demos. Topologies bound political communities.


- to be a _demos_, the people need a shared conception of identity
  - shared rights and duties


- a shared identity requires a way to communicate and share information
  - how do you share an identity? iteration, communication
  - what is an identity - who you are and who you are not, a social construct

- Habermas characterises democratic institutions as mediated communication networks connecting private individuals (citizens) with their collective identities (citizenship) (@cite).

*- we define a political network as a communication network that facilitates communication between individuals who shared some form of common identity*

We define a political network as the communication network between individuals who share a common political identity.  The set of nodes and connections between them represent a given *demos*.  The means of communications that exist between individuals belonging to the *demos* allows them to debate and persuade each other on the proper conduct of government and on issues of common interest.  This is a form of the public sphere identified by Habermas [@benkler_wealth_2006, p. 177].

The classical model of communication has four components: the communication source, the message communicated, the medium or channel used, and the receiver of the communication [@lilleber_key_2006, p. 17].  The nodes in a communication network are the sources and receivers of messages sent across the medium connecting them.  The medium may be speech, text printed in a book or pamphlet, sound, images, and video transmitted by mass media.  The medium affects how quickly a message is conveyed and to how many people can receive it.  A whispered conversation has a narrow and targeted audience, with the source and receiver speaking to each other face-to-face.  A television broadcast potentially has an audience of millions.  As this example suggests, different communication media have different levels of accessibility to citizens: anyone capable of hearing and speech can engage in a whispered discussion with another, but a television broadcast requires airtime on a television network.  The cost of using the medium to communicate with the desired audience affects how accessible it is to each citizen.

Each individual citizen in the *demos* is represented by a node in the political network.  The connections between the nodes represent a communication medium that allows those nodes to exchange messages.  These connections may be bidirectional if each node may communicate with the other in the same medium, or unidirectional if only one node may send a message to the other via that medium.  Unidirectional connections mean that the node receiving the message cannot respond with a similar message in the same context within the same communication medium.  Consider a speaker at a political rally: the crowd may respond with cheers or jeers, but the individuals in the crowd lack the privileges granted by standing on the podium and expressing their views to the audience.  The crowd cannot engage in an equal political discussion with the speaker in this context.  Unidirectional communication therefore grants the source *communicative privilege*, as her audience (as individuals) do not have the same opportunity to present their message to both the source and to the rest of the audience in the same way.

In contrast, bidirectional communication occurs when nodes can respond to the messages in the same communication medium.  Interpersonal communication is bidirectional, while the characteristics of different forms of technologically mediated communication determine whether it is unidirectional or bidirectional.  The form of technology used to communicate hence affects how political communication takes place and who is communicatively privileged over others in distributing their messages.  Different communication technologies allow for different connections to exist between nodes.  Individuals who are geographically distant from each other will lack a face-to-face connection, although a connection may exist via other communication media, such as letters, printed material, and mass media.  The possible connections across a variety of communication media also depend on the resources available to individuals.  Wealthy individuals are able to communicate with many more other citizens than poorer ones as they have access to a great range of communication media.  The wealthy are, quite literally, better connected than their less fortunate peers.

*- political networks are public networks. if it isnt connecting citizens, then it isn't political.  public sphere, shared understanding????*


*- a democratic network is one that has a dense peer to peer topology. cf autocratic networks that have certain nodes with communicative privilege.*

The topology of the political network represents the form of government of the *demos*.

## Communication Technology and the *Demos*

- The network technology bounds the demos
  - city-states, colonies, nations, global
  - democracy's demos can only expand to the extent of democratic network reach
  - cf autocratic empires that had reach greater than democracies

- The technological features of the communication networks that democracies use provides democracy with a degree of epistemic protection against bad actors.

- There is an inherent trade off between how narrowly the content of a message can be targeted at a specific group and how far that message can reach across a network.

*- narrow cast in Athens*

Public life in ancient Athens is represented by the *agora* (marketplace) [@habermas_structural_1989, p. 3].  The face-to-face communication of the *agora* allows speakers to target different audiences.  You could shout and be heard by all (making it a public message), or you could whisper and be heard by one (making it private).  The audience may be active by directly engaging publicly or privately with speakers in debate, or passive by only listening to the speaker's messages. Face-to-face, interpersonal communications are *narrowcast* political messages, as they are restricted to a specific intended audience.

*- add layer of newspaper broadcast in Colonies (narrowcast remains in town halls)*

In addition to interpersonal political communication, new technologies allow for political messages to reach larger audiences. The emergence of privately operated printing presses allowed for a greater range of political messages to be produced and distributed, even if they were critical of the state [@benkler_wealth_2006, p. 186].  Pamphlets and newspapers may serve as bidirectional communication, as individuals who disagree may respond with political messages of their own in the same medium.  Face-to-face communication, such as that in the Athenian *agora*, is bidirectional, but of course its reach and range is limited by the physical proximity to their audience.  The bidirectional communication printing made possible allowed for political discussion to occur across larger geographical areas and before a greater audience.

*TO DO: Clarify how print media are broadcast.

Unlike face-to-face communication, the political discussions of the Federalists or their opponents could not be easily tailored to suit particular audiences: their arguments were available to all who could read the newspapers printing them.  The *broadcast* nature of print media, where messages are received by those disinterested, neutral, or hostile to the message, as well as the intended audience [@lilleker_key_2006, pp. 46--48].

The Federalist Papers were a response to newspaper articles in support of rejecting the proposed Constitution (@kramnick_federalist_1987, p. 76).^[Proponents of the draft Constitution and the central federal government it would establish were known as Federalists; their opponents were hence Anti-Federalists [@kramnick_federalist_1987, p. 37].]

As the Federalist Papers themselves demonstrate, the arguments were visible to political opponents who could respond in kind, if there were printers or newspapers willing to print them.  While the use of pseudonyms in publishing static messages allows the messages to be tailored (since it allows an author to present different views under different names, to disguise their common source and without having to be consistent between them), in this case no such deception was intended: the views presented by Madison, Hamilton, and Jay as 'Publius' did not conflict with their public support for the Constitution.  Pseudonyms or anonymity in presenting a political message may be used for rhetorical purposes (such as the reference to the Roman Republic that 'Publius' signalled [@kramnick_federalist_1987, p. 72].) or to prevent the message's reception being influenced by any bias (positive or negative) that may result from it being attributed to a particular individual or group.

While the newspapers and pamphlets increased the reach of political messages, it also increased the asymmetry between the sources and recipents of these messages. The readers of newspapers and political pamplhets are largely a passive audience, unless they themselves have their political messages printed as well.  The range and distribution of newspapers also began to change as industrialisation increased the economies of scale of newspaper printing [@benkler_wealth_2006, p. 187].  Smaller, local newspapers found it more difficult to compete with cheaper, mass produced newspapers with larger geographical audiences.  Selling advertising space also became more important for funding the increasing costs of operating newspapers [@benkler_wealth_2006, p. 188].  This asymmetry between active speakers and large, passive, and geographically dispersed audiences, was further intensified by the development of radio and television in the 20th centry.

*- add new layer of radio/tv broadcast in nations (others remain)*

Radio and television allowed messages to be broadcast across a geographical range unmatched by messages conveyed via earlier technologies.  The unidirectional communication of these mass media networks from transmitters to passive receivers also makes them vulnerable to centralised control [@benkler_2006, p. 196].  Radio television allowed governments and heads of state to address their entire population instantly.  These messages are broadcast to the population, making them accessible to all with the technology necessary to receive them.  As a result, the message's audience is the entire population, rather than specific sections of it.  Messages conveyed via mass media are *broadcast*, where messages are received by those disinterested, neutral, or hostile to the message, as well as the intended audience [@lilleker_key_2006, pp. 46--48].  



Mass media also marks the point where public political discussion in democracies became more *unidirectional*: the audience cannot respond with their own messages in the same medium.  Unidirectional communication gives the speaker power, as her audience do not have the same privilege to present their own message to both the source and the rest of the audience in the same way.  Similarly, the operators of mass media broadcast networks have power over their audience as they decide which speakers appear on their broadcasts and whether they are presented favourably or otherwise.  

- each layer faces same trade off
  - broadcast cost increases
  - broadcast reach increase
  - msg discrimination decreases (more generic)
    - why?
    - the cost of delivery requires economies of scale which limits cost effectiveness of message discrimination
    - mass sophistry is difficult because different people have different biases and values
      - sophistry requires that we appeal to specific triggers     
    - when messages are costly, 
      - then need to be crafted so they can't be easily dismissed
      - limits blow back (motivating antagonistic voter)
      - if msg is manipulative, then it will be targeted at the biggest trigger point
      - reflection on dog whistling (#DD)
    - plus media laws limit the worst of this behaviour.      

This brief survey of communication networks, from the face-face communication of the Athenian *agora* to the television broadcasts of the 20th century, suggests an inverse relationship between the *reach* and *discrimination* of political messages.  A speaker in the *agora* can choose her audience by speaking to a select few in secret or to the entire assembly. However, who she may speak to is limited by the need to be face-to-face with her audience.  To reach a wider audience, she must commit her messages to writing.  In doing so, she loses some ability to choose who receives her message: such messages become less secure. Her audience can also directly respond to her messages with messages of their own, so the audience can be active participants in political debate. As new technologies emerged, as the printing press, radio, and television, the potential reach of political messages increased.  The size and geographical range of the political audience increased, at the cost of increasing the asymmetry between the speaker and the audience.  The static form of printed and broadcast messages also made it more difficult to ensure that political messages only reached a specific section within the audience.  Speakers were less able to be discriminate in their audience.  It also became more difficult for the audience to be active in political debate with speakers, as they increasingly received political messages in unidirectional forms.  Mass media communication networks allowed for political messages to reach national and international audiences, at the cost of limiting the speaker's ability to securely convey different messages to different groups.  It is this trade-off between reach and discrimination that is challenged by the Internet, and especially by the use of big data analytics to identify specific groups within the citizenry.

- the internet changes everything! (broadcast, low-cost, bi-direction, decentralised)
  - reach increases but is peer-to-peer
  - broadcast but at low cost
  - bi directional

The development of the personal computer created new possibilities for Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) between individuals, regardless of their geographical proximity.  Unlike the passive reception of messages via mass media, CMC describes interactive communication between people via information technology [@ess_computer-mediated_2004, p. 77].  The combination of personal computing and computer networks was hailed as promising an 'electronic *agora*', where individuals could again have political discussions as equals, rather than some have the privilege of access to mass media to convey their messages [@rheingold_virtual_1994, p. 14].

The reach of political messages via CMC is potentially global.  Depending on how CMC is used, the discussions could be public or private.  Political discussions conducted via email or other messaging systems would be private, as they are restricted to the communicating individuals.  Discussions via public forums allow political messages to be accessible to all who can access it, making such discussions public.  Messages on public forums may also be considered broadcast, as they are accessible to all.  Messages intended for a limited audience would be posted to forums that limit access to a specific group.^[The private forums of political websites are examples of this narrowcast messaging.]  However, these groups are self-selecting: only those interested in specific issues and who are accepted by the gatekeepers of these private forums will receive these narrowcast messages.  The messages in both broadcast public and private narrowcast forums would also be static: even if they are deleted, other users may have saved copies.  Private discussions may be either static or ephemeral, depending on the messaging system and whether any of the individuals involved save a copy of the conversation.

Political speakers wishing to make unreasonable claims (such as those which reject democratic norms of political equality, for example) must therefore conceal them from critical audiences.  Targeted messaging offers a possibility for achieving this through either concealing unreasonable claims within a seemingly reasonable argument by using terms that are interpreted differently by different groups (i.e., 'dog whistling'); and by communicating directly with a specific, sympathetic audience who are more likely to accept the speaker's claims.  These methods create the possibility of widely-distributed narrowcast messaging.  Such messages are still static, however, and so may leak outside the targeted group and become visible to the rest of the audience. 

- the institution is the topology
- anonymity
- disclosure laws

- "the platform provides communicative privilege"


## Act III - Big Data & Democracy

- closed social networks (facebook) vs open social networks (twitter) 

- social media leads to echo chambers
  - our information sources are not representative of the broader community
  - loss of cognitive diversity
    - because of the algorithm
      - purpose of the algotithm isnt truth, it's attention (eyeballs)
  - we are more likely to click thinks we already agree with or like
    - our social networks are like us
    - congruence bias
    - confirmation bias
    - base rate fallacy
  - privatisation of public space
    - habermas - we are fracturing the demos
- social media faciliates unreflective participation
  - contrast this with TV (passive), SM (active) 
  - supposition: active participation strengthen's belief (@cite)
  - emotive ideas propogate faster (@cite)
- anonymtity allows sock puppets to appropriate the credibility of the pecieved source
  - myside bias - info sourced from friends more likely to be accepted
  (cf federalists who used anonymitity to have message stand on its own feet)

- big data enables a deeper understanding of individual demo-psychographics
  - we can better exploit their biases
    - target smaller groups or even individuals
      - ML discovers new feature & categories
    - tracking enables more effective measurment of message response
      - we can learn what messages work and which don't (cf focus groups)

- big data + social media is bad for democracy
  - narrow targeting based on public features
    - targeted ads multiply socially shared info
    - anonymity circumvents traditional political disclosure laws
  - private networks reduce the cost of sophistry

Summary: Social networks have changed the political topology. Big data provides more insight into the preferences and biases of individuals.
