Thesis: The nature of communication networks provided democracy with epistemic robustness.  Big data and social media are now eroding this robustness.

## Act I - Democracy and Demagoguery

- Collective decision making has a surprisingly powerful epistemic value.

- Democracy can be viewed as a type of collective decision making

- Democracy's epistemic value is surprising given the cognitive foibles of the individuals involved

  - the problem of voter ignorance
  - cognitive flaws of human reasoning
  - diverse values of liberal societies

- Democratic processes overcome these foibles to produce superior epistemic value.

  - cjt only requires average voter competence of +50%
  - robust public debate identifies which choices are superior and why
  - social cognition overcomes many individual biases (myside myopia) 
  - public reason liberalism offers one solution to diverse values

- This presupposes a commitment to the truth by voters. Bad actors can still subvert democracy.

  - self interest can lead to subversion of democracy for private ends
    - see Habermas' "systemically distorted communication" in Knowledge and Human Interests

  - political manipulation exploits the psychological disconnect between what people do believe and what people should believe

  - Democracy can be corrupted by demagogy (exploiting prejudice and ignorance), sophistry (clever but fallacious), and apathy (preventing people from caring)

    - example demagogy
    - example sophistry
    - example apathy

- Bad actors need not change peoples from antagonists to protagonists

  - increasing voter turnout amongst protagonistic voters
  - suppressing voter turnout amongst antagonistic voters
  - shifting voter preference amongst undecided voters
  - undermining confidence in the legitimacy of democratic outcomes
    - both foreign powers and oligarchs


## Act II - The Network & The Demos

- The network defines the demos. Typologies bound political communities.

  - to be a _demos_, the people need a shared conception of identity

  - a shared identity requires a way to communicate and share information
    - how do you share an identity? iteration, communication
    - what is an identity - who you are and who you are not, a social construct

  - Habermas characterises democratic institutions as mediated communication networks connecting private individuals (citizens) with their collective identities (citizenship) (@cite).

  - we define a political network as a communication network that facilitates communication between individuals who shared some form of common identity

    - shared rights and duties

    - political networks are public networks. if it isnt connecting citizens, then it isn't political.  public sphere, shared understanding????

  - a democratic network is one that has a dense peer to peer typology. cf autocratic networks that have certain nodes with communicative privilege.
    - uni vs bidirection

  - The network technology bounds the demos
    - city-states, colonies, nations, global
    - democracy's demos can only expand to the extent of democratic network reach
    - cf autocratic empires that had reach greater than democracies

- The technological features of the communication networks that democracies use provides democracy with a degree of epistemic protection against bad actors.

  - There is an inherent trade off between how narrowly the content of a message can be targeted at a specific group and how far that message can reach across a network.

  - narrow cast in Athens
  - add layer of newspaper broadcast in Colonies (narrowcast remains in town halls)
  - add new layer of radio/tv broadcast in nations (others remain)
  - each lay faces same trade off
    - broadcast cost increases
    - broadcast reach increase
    - msg discrimination decreases (more generic)
      - why?
      - the cost of delivery requires economies of scale which limits cost effectiveness of message discrimination
    - mass sophistry is difficult because different people have different biases and values
      - sophistry requires that we appeal to specific triggers     
    - when messages are costly, 
      - then need to be crafted so they can't be easily dismissed
      - limits blow back (motivating antagonistic voter)
      - if msg is manipulative, then it will be targeted at the biggest trigger point
      - reflection on dog whistling (#DD)
    - plus media laws limit the worst of this behaviour.      

  - the internet changes everything! (broadcast, low-cost, bi-direction, decentralised)
    - reach increases but is peer-to-peer
    - broadcast but at low cost
    - bi directional

- the institution is the typology
- anonymity
- disclosure laws

- "the platform provides communicative privilege"


## Act III - Big Data & Democracy

- closed social networks (facebook) vs open social networks (twitter) 

- social media leads to echo chambers
  - our information sources are not representative of the broader community
  - loss of cognitive diversity
    - because of the algorithm
      - purpose of the algotithm isnt truth, it's attention (eyeballs)
  - we are more likely to click thinks we already agree with or like
    - our social networks are like us
    - congruence bias
    - confirmation bias
    - base rate fallacy
  - privatisation of public space
    - habermas - we are fracturing the demos
- social media faciliates unreflective participation
  - contrast this with TV (passive), SM (active) 
  - supposition: active participation strengthen's belief (@cite)
  - emotive ideas propogate faster (@cite)
- anonymtity allows sock puppets to appropriate the credibility of the pecieved source
  - myside bias - info sourced from friends more likely to be accepted
  (cf federalists who used anonymitity to have message stand on its own feet)

- big data enables a deeper understanding of individual demo-psychographics
  - we can better exploit their biases
    - target smaller groups or even individuals
      - ML discovers new feature & categories
    - tracking enables more effective measurment of message response
      - we can learn what messages work and which don't (cf focus groups)

- big data + social media is bad for democracy
  - narrow targeting based on public features
    - targeted ads multiply socially shared info
    - anonymity circumvents traditional political disclosure laws
  - private networks reduce the cost of sophistry

Summary: Social networks have changed the political typology. Big data provides more insight into the preferences and biases of individuals.
