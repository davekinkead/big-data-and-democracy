Thesis: The nature of communication networks provided democracy with epistemic robustness.  Big data and social media are now eroding this robustness.

# Act I - Democracy and Demagoguery

### Collective decision making has a surprisingly powerful epistemic value.

Plato is infamous for his disdain of democracy.  Like being ruled by a jury of children, democracy erodes reason by suffocating the voice of wisdom in a cloud of ignorance.  Like a ship at sea, the state needs specialist knowledge and skill - the keen eye of the navigator and the calm hand of an experienced captain - to steer it through troubled waters.

Decisions made by an unskilled and uniformed _demos_ will always be inferior to those of philosopher-monarchs.  Democratic policy will be determined by base desire rather than reason.  A state ruled by the people will inevitably succumb to the siren's song of a persuasive orator whose lust for power and manipulation of the masses can only result in tyranny.

To rule well, one must have expertise, knowledge, and wisdom. It is obvious then that the decisions of an _episitocracy_ will be superior to the decisions of a _democracy_.

2000 years later, the polymath Sir Francis Galton harboured similar thoughts about decision making.  He was surprised to discover however, that after calculating the results of 787 bets on the estimated weight of an ox at a country fair, the median result of the _vox populi_ was within 0.8% of the actual weight (@galton1907).

This result highlights the intriguing epistemic value of collective decision making involving disparate actors - that whenever people of diverse cognitive ability reason collectively in a setting that rewards truth tracking, the collective judgment will be, probabilistically at least, superior to the judgment of any one individual.

The superior epistemic value of collective reasoning is a theme found across a variety of disciplines.  In economics, @hayek1945 championed the superiority of free-markets over centrally planned economies where free individual actors informed by price signals can better allocate resources than a central committee, despite no one actor having a comprehensive overall understanding of the economy.  

In science, @kitcher1990 demonstrated how individual cognitive diversity improves collective knowledge when we don't know the truth ahead of time.  Sometimes dubbed the _wisdom of the crowds_ (@surowiecki2004), these approaches to collective decision making have recently manifested as prediction markets for intelligence analysis (@cia) and data science out sourcing (@kaggle).

### Democracy can be viewed as a type of collective decision making

Democracy, of course, is no stranger to this epistemic theme.  Whilst Plato may have preferred epistocracy to democracy, scholars since the enlightenment have been embracing democracy's epistemic power.  Rousseau thought that individuals stating their opinion on a matter by voting would elicit the general will of the people, a general opinion that would be superior than one's own (@rousseau1762).  @jsmill1869 (Ch II) argued that free expression in public debate allowed us to exchanging our errors for truth while @dewey1935 (Liberalism and Social Action ยง52) saw democracy as a way to share the rich store of accumulated wealth of human knowledge.

These _epistemic_ justifications of democracy have seen a resurgence in contemporary political theory in a range of accounts such as public reason (@rawls_political_2005), deliberative democracy (@habermas, @goodin2017), and procedural accounts (@list2001, @estlund2009).  Despite their diversity in _how_ they justify democratic legitimacy, epistemic accounts are united in their claim that democratic processes are better, on average at least, at tracking the truth on particular matters than any one individual is. 

### Democracy's epistemic value is surprising given the cognitive foibles of the individuals involved

Plato's scepticism of democracy's epistemic value was justified however, when one considers the cognitive capacities and skills of its constituents. ....

  - the problem of voter ignorance
  - cognitive flaws of human reasoning @dk after part 3
  - diverse values of liberal societies

### Democratic processes overcome these foibles to produce superior epistemic value.

Yet democratic decision processes, whether merely aggregative like voting, or transformative like deliberation, somehow manage to overcome these foibles of individual cognition and values, to produce collective epistemic virtue that is superior or any one individual.

In a purely aggregative account of democracy such as Condorcet's Jury Theorem, voters need not interact beyond voting for majorities to deliver superior epistemic outcomes.  So long as voters on average have a better than even chance of being correct on some issue, the likelihood of the majority vote being correct approaches certainty as the number of voters increases (@condorcet1976)[^cjt].  To give the theorem some concrete context, if the average competence of the electorate is just 51% (marginally better than a coin flip), then the majority vote of 101 voters has a 57% chance of being correct, and 10,001 voters have a 99.99% chance.

[^cjt] The Jury Theorem makes a number of assumptions about voter competence, voter independence, and the objective correctness of some binary choice.  Since Condorcet first published his theorem in 1785, many of these assumptions have been generalised (see @baker1976, @paroush1998, @owen1989, @kanazawa1998, @fey2003, @list2001)

Underpinning the superiority of collective over individual decision making in aggregative accounts like the Jury Theorem is the nature of randomness and imperfection.  As we have seen, human cognition has many biases that lead to faulty reasoning.  While often consistent within individuals, well exhibit a degree of random error in our reasoning processes.  If these errors are normally distributed, then across large numbers of individuals, these errors will cancel each other out.

In transformative accounts, the public nature of political discourse identifies both which choices are superior and why.

  - robust public debate identifies which choices are superior and why
  - social cognition overcomes many individual biases (myside myopia) 
  - public reason liberalism offers one solution to diverse values

### This presupposes a commitment to the truth by voters. Bad actors can still subvert democracy.

  - self interest can lead to subversion of democracy for private ends
    - see Habermas' "systemically distorted communication" in Knowledge and Human Interests @dd

  - political manipulation exploits the psychological disconnect between what people do believe and what people should believe @dd



Democracy may be corrupted by demagoguery, sophistry, and apathy.  Demagoguery and sophistry are two reasons for Plato's hostility to democracy.  In the *Sophist* (267b-c), Plato distinguishes between demagogues (someone who "can maintain his insincerity in long speeches to a crowd") and sophists (those "us[ing] short speeches in private conversation to force the person talking with him to contradict himself").  Demagogues seek and maintain political power by exploiting prejudice and ignorance within the citizenry, and by portraying themselves as the only solution to the society's real or imagined problems.

Sophistry is the use of argumentative and persuasive techniques to convince an audience of something even if it is inconsistent with the facts or the audience's own stated beliefs and commitments.  In the *Gorgias*, Plato's Socrates presses the claim against the orator Gorgias that a good orator can be more persuasive to those without expert knowledge of a subject than an expert (459b). As a result, skilled communicators can be persuasive without necessarily being knowledgeable about their subject.  If the audience is not well educated about the subject under debate, they may be persuaded to accept a conclusion that does not depend on the truth of its statements or the logic of the arguments presented to convince its audience to support a political decision.

The third corrupting factor, apathy, weakens democracy by discouraging interest and participation in politics.  As a result, those who vote or otherwise influence political decisions are less representative of the entire society.  The lack of interest in politics by sections of the community may be exploited by others to allow political inequalities to continue or expand at the expense of the apathetic.

### Bad actors need not change peoples from antagonists to protagonists

It should be made clear here that demagogues and sophists don't need to change the voting patterns of large swaths of the citizenry in order to subvert the epistemic value of democracy.  Small shifts at the margins are often sufficient.  Trump's 2016 win, for example, was decided by fewer than 100,000 votes across three key states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin (@fec2016).

Neither do they need to radically shift the beliefs of the citizenry from one side of an issue to the other.  Empiric research suggests that it is very difficult to change voting behaviour of citizens who already identify with a party or issue (@cite).  Despite our cognitive flaws, and often because of them, it is difficult to alter entrenched beliefs (@cite belief preservation).  Instead, demagogues and sophists can undermine epistemic democracy in four key ways: increasing voter turnout amongst protagonistic voters; suppressing voter turnout amongst antagonistic voters; shifting voter preference amongst undecided voters; and undermining confidence in the legitimacy of democratic outcomes.

# Act II - The Network & The Demos

### To be a _demos_, the people need a shared conception of identity

The idea of democracy presupposes the notion of a _demos_ - some determinate group of individuals who form a _people_.  It is this people, and not some other, for whom democracy is the rule of, by, and for.  It is this people, and not some other, who share political rights and owe duties to each other.

A stable democracy requires a shared identity and culture.  Its people need to identify as one group if they are to hold sufficient solidarity necessary for collective rule.  Without this shared identity, the demos is likely to fracture and balkanise into smaller demoi. This shared identity need not be exclusive however. An individual may identify with multiple overlapping _peoples_ but the individuals within a _people_ must always identify as one.

### A shared identity requires a way to communicate and share information

A shared identity however, requires some means to share it.  A demos requires some form of communication network for its culture, norms, and political messages to be transmitted, understood, and evaluated by citizens.

  - Habermas summary here  (@cite).

In this light, democratic institutions can be conceptualised as mediated communication networks connecting private individuals (the citizens) with their collective identities (their citizenship).

### The network defines the demos. 

The classical model of communication has four components: the communication source, the message communicated, the medium or channel used, and the receiver of the communication [@lilleber_key_2006, p. 17].  These components form a network.  The nodes in a network are the sources and receivers of messages sent across the medium connecting them and the pattern of these connections it the network's _topology_.

We define a political network then, as the communication network between individuals who share some common political identity.  The senders and receivers of political information - both explicit political messages as well as common norms and cultural information - are the citizens.  The set of nodes and connections between them represent a given _demos_.

What demarcates one _demos_ from another then, is a function of the communication networks that connect the citizens of those _demoi_. Viewed from the perspective of a network topology, the demos is simply any sufficiently connected group of individuals who share some form of common political culture and identity. 

### Topologies bound political communities.

A demos cannot grow beyond its political network.  The information flows necessary to facilitate a shared political identity require a sufficiently dense concentration of connections between citizens.  As the these connections grow, so does the potential scope of the demos.

  - Topologies can form many patterns.  they enable C&C
  - Autocratic topology - star shaped.
  - Democratic topologies: Rule by the people requires a particular pattern -- dense peer-to-peer.  

*- political networks are public networks. if it isnt connecting citizens, then it isn't political.  public sphere, shared understanding????*

*- a democratic network is one that has a dense peer to peer topology. cf autocratic networks that have certain nodes with communicative privilege.*

The topology of the political network represents the form of government of the _demos_.

### Topologies are limited by communication technology 

Yet these political topologies are themselves a function of the communicative medium.  In the early democracies such as Athens, communication was limited to face-to-face discussion or parchment.  The means of political communication were limited the range of one's voice or how far a letter could be carried.  The scope of shared political identity was therefore limited to one's neighbours and neighbour's neighbours.  Democratic government was constrained to city-states as the necessary means of command and control for larger scale rule was missing.

This is not to say that larger empires were not possible given the communication technologies of voice and parchment.  The Roman Empire shows how very large scale rule was possible with this technology.  The Command & Control that Rome used to exercise control over vast swathes of Europe and Africa however, relied on autocratic rather than democratic topologies. The nascent democratisation Gracchi's Rome never extended to the rest of the empire.

The invention of the printing press and rise of the newspaper and pamphleteers as a mode of political communication increased the possible scope of democratic association.  Democracies in this technological era emerged in the American colonies and suffrage expanded in England.  Later, the development of radio and television saw  ....

  - The topology of the political network represents the form of government of the *demos*. An autocratic government has a top-down political network: the rulers have significant communicative privileges over those at lower levels of the government and over the governed.

  - utopian internet

Network topologies bound political communities and these topologies are constrained by communication technology. As democratic topologies grew, so did larger conceptions of political identity.

> need to sharpen this part to make clear that there were large formal democracies before

  - city-states, colonies, nations, global
  - democracy's demos can only expand to the extent of democratic network reach
  - cf autocratic empires that had reach greater than democracies

### The technological features of the communication networks that democracies use provides democracy with a degree of epistemic protection against bad actors.

Whilst the topology of the communication network bounds the scope of the demos and the communications technology constrained the scope of the topology, the nature of communication medium has also provided democracy with a degree of epistemic robustness from individuals seeking to subvert the truth tracking characteristics of democratic procedures for their own gain.

An inherent trade-off has existed for much of communication history between how narrowly the content of a message can be targeted at a specific group and how far that message can reach across a network.

In Athens, political communication was characterised by face-to-face speech.  One could stand in the Agora and shout to be heard by all, or one could whisper to individuals in private.  The scope for sophistry was greatest in private.  When conversing with an individual, one could develop a rich understanding of their values, motivations, wants and needs.  One could craft a message that was highly targeted to maximally exploit this understanding and manipulate the other for one's own ends.  

-- use the language of Plato concrening sophistry here ^^^

When speaking to all in the Agora however, the scope for sophistry was more limited.  The increased diversity of individual values made specific appeals to emotion and authority more difficult as what might persuade some could dissuade others.  Furthermore, because the Agora was a forum of _public_ debate, others were able to respond.  Different perspectives could be offered and flaws in one's argument could be more easily identified by others.  Being called out as a sophist now carried a cost, both in damage to one's reputation and the persuasive backfire effect when the manipulation of others was identified.

The technological trade-off that helped keep democracy epistemically robust, between broadcast and narrow cast, between the reach of a message and the ability target it to a segment of the audience, began emerge.  The public nature of the broadcast communication constrained the worst of sophist behaviour, although as the history of democratically elected demagogues shows, it doesn't guarantee against it.

In addition to face-to-face political communication, new technologies allow for political messages to reach larger audiences. The emergence of privately operated printing presses allowed for a greater range of political messages to be produced and distributed, even if they were critical of the state [@benkler_wealth_2006, p. 186].  Pamphlets and newspapers served as public bidirectional communication, as individuals who disagree may respond with political messages of their own in the same medium.  Face-to-face communication, such as that in the Athenian *Agora*, is bidirectional, but of course its reach and range is limited by the physical proximity to their audience.  The bidirectional communication printing made possible allowed for political discussion to occur across larger geographical areas and before a greater audience.

While new technologies such as the printing press expanded the range of a political message, they typically did so at the cost of reducing the source's ability to limit their message to a specific audience. For example, consider the Federalist Papers, a series of political essays that themselves were a response to newspaper articles in support of rejecting the proposed Constitution for the United States of America [@kramnick_federalist_1987, p. 76].  Unlike face-to-face communication, the political discussions of the Federalists or their opponents could not be easily tailored to suit particular audiences: their arguments were available to all who could read the newspapers printing them.  The *broadcast* nature of print media means that messages are received by those disinterested, neutral, or hostile to the message, as well as the intended audience [@lilleker_key_2006, pp. 46--48].

Printed messages also allow for the source of the message to be disguised, either by releasing them anonymously or by attributing them to a pseudonym.  The use of pseudonyms or anonymity in publishing messages allows the messages to be tailored, as it allows an author to present different views under different names, to disguise their common source and without having to be consistent between them. ^[In the case of the Federalist Papers, no such deception was intended: the views presented by Madison, Hamilton, and Jay as 'Publius' did not conflict with their public support for the Constitution.]  Pseudonyms or anonymity in presenting a political message may be used for rhetorical purposes (such as the reference to the Roman Republic that 'Publius' signalled [@kramnick_federalist_1987, p. 72].) or to prevent the message's reception being influenced by any bias (positive or negative) that may result from it being attributed to a particular individual or group.

While newspapers and pamphlets increased the reach of political messages, it also made political communication more unidirectional.  The readers of newspapers and political pamphlets are largely a passive audience, unless they themselves have their political messages printed as well.  While audience members could still respond in the same medium, it required finding a printer or newspaper willing to print their response.  Bidirectional communication started to become a privilege.  The range and distribution of newspapers also began to change as industrialisation increased the economies of scale of newspaper printing [@benkler_wealth_2006, p. 187].  Smaller, local newspapers found it more difficult to compete with cheaper, mass produced newspapers with larger geographical audiences.  Selling advertising space also became more important for funding the increasing costs of operating newspapers [@benkler_wealth_2006, p. 188].  This asymmetry between active speakers and large, passive, and geographically dispersed audiences, was further intensified by the development of radio and television in the 20th century.

- contradiction here between uni & bi-directional earlier

Radio and television allowed messages to be broadcast across a geographical range unmatched by messages conveyed via earlier technologies.  Radio and television allowed governments and heads of state to address their entire population instantly.  These messages are broadcast to the population, making them accessible to all with the technology necessary to receive them.  As a result, the message's audience is the entire population, rather than specific sections of it.  The unidirectional communication of these mass media networks from transmitters to passive receivers also makes them vulnerable to centralised control [@benkler_2006, p. 196].  The operators of mass media broadcast networks enjoy significant communicative privileges, as they decide what messages appear on their broadcasts and whether they are presented favourably or otherwise.
 
The communicative privileges afforded to those who control mass media comes at the cost of the ability of communicating directly to a specific group without the rest of the audience receiving the same message.  Mass media messages are expensive to produce, so speakers have strong motivations to make their messages acceptable to as broad an audience as possible.  It becomes less cost effective to tailor political messages towards a specific group within the broader audience.  This accessibility of broadcast political messages imposes its own constraints on the kinds of messages that are sent.  Tailored messages that strongly resonate with specific groups may inspire greater resistance from other groups in the audience.  Political speakers who utilise mass media therefore must either accept that their message will only resonate with a specific group (and that their target audience is sufficiently large to overcome the political backlash from other groups), or present messages that are interpreted differently by different groups, so that the target group hears a message that resonates strongly with them without antagonising the broader audience (i.e., 'dog whistling') [goodin_dog_2005, p. 471].

Despite these practical reasons for crafting messages that appeal to a broad audience, mass media will always be associated with the spread of propaganda. While propaganda has always existed in political communication, the combination of reach and the vividness of the sounds and imagery it can convey, made mass media an excellent platform for it.  To counter this, there are often laws and regulations in place that limit what can be said in political messages if the state is sincere in fostering public political discussion.  Attribution to a specific individual or political party is often required to ensure that speakers are accountable for their messages.  These laws and regulations are intended to prevent the abuse of the communicative privileges that mass media gives to those able to utilise it.  

The development of the personal computer created new possibilities for Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) between individuals, regardless of their geographical proximity.  Unlike the passive reception of messages via mass media, CMC describes interactive communication between people via information technology [@ess_computer-mediated_2004, p. 77].  The combination of personal computing and computer networks was hailed as promising an 'electronic *agora*', where individuals could again have political discussions as equals, rather than some have the privilege of access to mass media to convey their messages [@rheingold_virtual_1994, p. 14].  As Howard Rheingold asks rhetorically in his 1994 book *The Virtual Community*: "Which scenario seems more conducive to democracy, which to totalitarian rule: a world in which a few people control communications technology that can be used to manipulate the beliefs of billions, or a world in which every citizen can broadcast to every other citizen?" [-@rheingold_virtual_1994, p. 14] 

The reach of political messages via CMC is potentially global. Individuals could more quickly and easily communicate with those living within another _demos_.  The cost of communicating to a large audience was also significantly reduced, making broadcasting messages accessible to more individuals.  The communicative privileges needed to broadcast political messages is significantly reduced.  It also made it easier to adopt pseudonyms or post messages anonymously, which made it easier for individuals at risk of persecution for their views to broadcast messages, while also creating new possibilities for deception.  However, it was more difficult to discriminate between audiences. Anyone with a link to a political message posted on the Internet is able to check it themselves.

This brief survey of communication networks, from the face-face communication of the Athenian *agora* to the Internet, suggests an inverse relationship between the *reach* and *discrimination* of political messages.  A speaker in the *agora* can choose her audience by speaking quietly to a select few or loudly to the entire assembly. However, who she may speak to is limited by the need to be face-to-face with her audience.  As new technologies emerged, as the printing press, radio, and television, the potential reach of political messages increased.  The size and geographical range of the audience increases, at the cost of communication becoming more unidirectional.  The static form of printed and broadcast messages also made it more difficult to ensure that political messages only reached a specific section within the audience.  The general characteristics of these forms of public political discussion are listed in the following table.  It is this trade-off between reach and discrimination that is challenged by the combination of social media and big data analytics to identify and broadcast messages to specific groups within the audience. 

|Medium                           | Direction      | Reach                  | Cost    | Targeting  |

# Act III - Big Data & Democracy

### closed social networks vs open social networks

As is usually the case, the reality of the Internet's impact on democracy has turned out considerably different to its Utopian promise.  The promise of access to a world of diverse perspectives is not reflected in the experience of many Internet users. 

The emergence of walled gardens ....

How social media has become a medium of political communication

Not all social networks are closed .... best conceptualised as degrees of closeness from private spaces and algorithmically determined content (facebook) to public spaces with user determined content (twitter)

### social media leads to echo chambers

The first major challenge social media presents to the epistemic value of democracy is the echo chamber effect prevalent in closed networks ...

Users of social networks tend to associate with others who share the same interests and characteristics, an effect called homophily [@tufekci_twitter_2017, p. 9].  While social networks make it easier for individuals to find others who share their interests, it also makes it easier to limit their Internet interaction to those who share her views.  Individuals on social networks share news stories and Internet sources that reflect their views, and that are likely to interest their friends.  The news items users see via social media will therefore tend to conform to their biases.  This is the 'echo chamber' effect 

At best, content is filtered by the user

At worst, content is filtered algorithmically to maximise user attention.

The explosion of perspective and source

  - our information sources are not representative of the broader community
  - loss of cognitive diversity
    - because of the algorithm
      - purpose of the algorithm isnt truth, it's attention (eyeballs)
  - we are more likely to click thinks we already agree with or like
    - our social networks are like us
    - congruence bias
    - confirmation bias
    - base rate fallacy
  - privatisation of public space
    - habermas - we are fracturing the demos

### social media facilitates unreflective participation

  - contrast this with TV (passive), SM (active) 
  - supposition: active participation strengthen's belief (@cite)
  - emotive ideas propagate faster (@cite)

### anonymity allows sock puppets to appropriate the credibility of the perceived source

  - myside bias - info sourced from friends more likely to be accepted
  (cf federalists who used anonymity to have message stand on its own feet)

### big data enables a deeper understanding of individual demo-psychographics
  - we can better exploit their biases
    - target smaller groups or even individuals
      - ML discovers new feature & categories
    - tracking enables more effective measurement of message response
      - we can learn what messages work and which don't (cf focus groups)

### big data + social media is bad for democracy
  - narrow targeting based on public features
    - targeted ads multiply socially shared info
    - anonymity circumvents traditional political disclosure laws
  - private networks reduce the cost of sophistry

Summary: Social networks have changed the political topology. Big data provides more insight into the preferences and biases of individuals.
