Thesis: The nature of communication networks provided democracy with epistemic robustness.  Big data and social media are now eroding this robustness.

## Act I - Democracy and Demagoguery

1. Collective decision making has a surprisingly powerful epistemic value.

Plato is infamous for his disdain of democracy.  Like being ruled by a jury of children, democracy erodes reason by suffocating the voice of wisdom in a cloud of ignorance.  Like a ship at sea, the state needs specialist knowledge and skill - the keen eye of the navigator and the calm hand of an experienced captain - to steer it through troubled waters.

Decisions made by an unskilled and uniformed _demos_ will always be inferior to those of philosopher-monarchs.  Democratic policy will be determined by base desire rather than reason.  A state ruled by the people will inevitably succumb to the siren's song of a persuasive orator whose lust for power and manipulation of the masses can only result in tyranny.

To rule well, one must have expertise, knowledge, and wisdom. It is obvious then that the decisions of an _episitocracy_ should be superior to the decisions of a _democracy_.

2000 years later, the polymath Sir Francis Galton harboured similar thoughts about decision making.  Until that is, he calculated the results of 787 bets on the estimated weight of an ox at a country fair and discovered that the median result of the _vox populi_ was within 0.8% of the actual weight (@galton1907).

This result highlights the intriguing epistemic value of collective decision making involving disparate actors - that whenever people of diverse cognitive ability reason collectively in a setting that rewards truth tracking, the collective judgment will be, probabilistically at least, superior to the judgment of any one individual.

The superior epistemic value of collective reasoning is a theme found across a variety of disciplines.  In economics, @hayek1945 championed the superiority of free-markets over centrally planned economies where free individual actors informed by price signals can better allocate resources than a central committee, despite no one actor having a comprehensive understanding of the economy.  

In science, @kitcher1990 demonstrated how individual cognitive diversity improves collective knowledge when we don't know the truth ahead of time.  Sometimes dubbed the _wisdom of the crowds_ (@cite), these approaches to collective decision making have recently manifested as prediction markets for intelligence analysis (@cia) and data science out sourcing (@kaggle)

2. Democracy can be viewed as a type of collective decision making

Democracy, of course, is no stranger to this epistemic theme.  Whilst Plato may have preferred epistocracy to democracy, enlightenment scholars were embracing democracy's epistemic power.  Rousseau thought that individuals stating their opinion on a matter by voting would elicit the general will of the people, a general opinion that would be superior than one's own (@rousseau1762). 

Mill "QUOTE" as did Dewey "QUOTE" ... 

These _epistemic_ justifications of democracy have seen a resurgence in contemporary political theory in a range of accounts such as public reason (@rawls), deliberative democracy (@habermas), and procedural accounts (@list, @estlund).  Despite their diversity in _how_ they justify democratic legitimacy, epistemic accounts are united in their claim that democratic processes are better, on average at least, at tracking the truth on particular matters than any one individual is. 

3. Democracy's epistemic value is surprising given the cognitive foibles of the individuals involved

  - the problem of voter ignorance
  - cognitive flaws of human reasoning
  - diverse values of liberal societies

- Democratic processes overcome these foibles to produce superior epistemic value.

  - cjt only requires average voter competence of +50%
  - robust public debate identifies which choices are superior and why
  - social cognition overcomes many individual biases (myside myopia) 
  - public reason liberalism offers one solution to diverse values

- This presupposes a commitment to the truth by voters. Bad actors can still subvert democracy.

  - self interest can lead to subversion of democracy for private ends
    - see Habermas' "systemically distorted communication" in Knowledge and Human Interests

  - political manipulation exploits the psychological disconnect between what people do believe and what people should believe

  - Democracy can be corrupted by demagogy (exploiting prejudice and ignorance), sophistry (clever but fallacious), and apathy (preventing people from caring)

    - example demagogy
    - example sophistry
    - example apathy

- Bad actors need not change peoples from antagonists to protagonists

  - increasing voter turnout amongst protagonistic voters
  - suppressing voter turnout amongst antagonistic voters
  - shifting voter preference amongst undecided voters
  - undermining confidence in the legitimacy of democratic outcomes
    - both foreign powers and oligarchs


## Act II - The Network & The Demos

- The network defines the demos. Typologies bound political communities.

  - to be a _demos_, the people need a shared conception of identity

  - a shared identity requires a way to communicate and share information
    - how do you share an identity? iteration, communication
    - what is an identity - who you are and who you are not, a social construct

  - Habermas characterises democratic institutions as mediated communication networks connecting private individuals (citizens) with their collective identities (citizenship) (@cite).

  - we define a political network as a communication network that facilitates communication between individuals who shared some form of common identity

    - shared rights and duties

    - political networks are public networks. if it isnt connecting citizens, then it isn't political.  public sphere, shared understanding????

  - a democratic network is one that has a dense peer to peer typology. cf autocratic networks that have certain nodes with communicative privilege.
    - uni vs bidirection

  - The network technology bounds the demos
    - city-states, colonies, nations, global
    - democracy's demos can only expand to the extent of democratic network reach
    - cf autocratic empires that had reach greater than democracies

- The technological features of the communication networks that democracies use provides democracy with a degree of epistemic protection against bad actors.

  - There is an inherent trade off between how narrowly the content of a message can be targeted at a specific group and how far that message can reach across a network.

  - narrow cast in Athens
  - add layer of newspaper broadcast in Colonies (narrowcast remains in town halls)
  - add new layer of radio/tv broadcast in nations (others remain)
  - each lay faces same trade off
    - broadcast cost increases
    - broadcast reach increase
    - msg discrimination decreases (more generic)
      - why?
      - the cost of delivery requires economies of scale which limits cost effectiveness of message discrimination
    - mass sophistry is difficult because different people have different biases and values
      - sophistry requires that we appeal to specific triggers     
    - when messages are costly, 
      - then need to be crafted so they can't be easily dismissed
      - limits blow back (motivating antagonistic voter)
      - if msg is manipulative, then it will be targeted at the biggest trigger point
      - reflection on dog whistling (#DD)
    - plus media laws limit the worst of this behaviour.      

  - the internet changes everything! (broadcast, low-cost, bi-direction, decentralised)
    - reach increases but is peer-to-peer
    - broadcast but at low cost
    - bi directional

- the institution is the typology
- anonymity
- disclosure laws

- "the platform provides communicative privilege"


## Act III - Big Data & Democracy

- closed social networks (facebook) vs open social networks (twitter) 

- social media leads to echo chambers
  - our information sources are not representative of the broader community
  - loss of cognitive diversity
    - because of the algorithm
      - purpose of the algotithm isnt truth, it's attention (eyeballs)
  - we are more likely to click thinks we already agree with or like
    - our social networks are like us
    - congruence bias
    - confirmation bias
    - base rate fallacy
  - privatisation of public space
    - habermas - we are fracturing the demos
- social media faciliates unreflective participation
  - contrast this with TV (passive), SM (active) 
  - supposition: active participation strengthen's belief (@cite)
  - emotive ideas propogate faster (@cite)
- anonymtity allows sock puppets to appropriate the credibility of the pecieved source
  - myside bias - info sourced from friends more likely to be accepted
  (cf federalists who used anonymitity to have message stand on its own feet)

- big data enables a deeper understanding of individual demo-psychographics
  - we can better exploit their biases
    - target smaller groups or even individuals
      - ML discovers new feature & categories
    - tracking enables more effective measurment of message response
      - we can learn what messages work and which don't (cf focus groups)

- big data + social media is bad for democracy
  - narrow targeting based on public features
    - targeted ads multiply socially shared info
    - anonymity circumvents traditional political disclosure laws
  - private networks reduce the cost of sophistry

Summary: Social networks have changed the political typology. Big data provides more insight into the preferences and biases of individuals.
