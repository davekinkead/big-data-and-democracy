Thesis: The nature of communication networks provided democracy with epistemic robustness.  Big data and social media are now eroding this robustness.

## Act I

1. Democracy is valuable but imperfect
  - churchill's trope
  - why is it valuable? - fairness, justice, equality, knowledge
  - epistemic justifications
  - condorcet's jury theorm
  - deliberative accounts

2. Epistemic justifications must overcome significant challenges (its foibles)

  - the challenge of epistemic democracy is generate superior answers despite:

    1. knowledge deficiencies: voters lack the necessary knowledge & expertise to make informed judgements accross a wide range of issues

    2. cognative biases: all humans suffer from faulty reasoning to some degree

    3. divergent values: all humans hold a range of diverse values (we are biased to our own point of view)

  - despite these challenges, epistemic democracy does overcome them and in the case of 3 and sometimes 2, turns them into positives
  - divergent view points are essential to the strengh of aggregative accounts
  - bandwagon effect can be positive when the process is truth tracking

3. Further complications arise when participants are not commited democrats (its saboteurs)

  - self interest can lead to subversion of democracy for private ends
  - Democracy can be corrupted by demogogy, sophistry, and indifference
  - sophistry expliots the psychological disconnect between what people do believe and what people should believe
  - increasing voter turnout amongst protagnonistic voters
  - suppressing voter turnout amongst antagonistic voters
  - shifting voter preference amongst undecided voters
  - undermining confidence in the legitimacy of democratic outcomes

## Act 2

4. The nature of communication networks keep democracy epistemically robust
