# The Network is the Demos

The Historical Account

  - history of democracy from the perspective of media networks
  - athenians (agora, symmetric active & passive participation, local demos)
  - federalists (newspaper, asymmetric favouring active participants, regional demos)
  - 1920's (radio, more asymemetric to active, national demos)
  - mass media (tv, huge asymmetry to active, very broad demos)

Attributes of the networks

  - asymmetry of power
  - cost of production
  - 1 to 1, vs 1 to many, many to many, (some to some)
  - geographical reach
  - discrimination of message

# Individualised Media fragements the Demos

Demonstrate how new media fragments traditional mass media networks

  - how does the internet fragment our comms networks?
  - distinction between following blogs/producers & SM news feed
  - individualised media (internet, massive centralisation, decoupling of message discrimination)
  - how much of our attention is drawn to walled gardens
  - cf mass media ownership laws
  - individual responses in SM are not public in the traditional sense (the appropriation of public comms space)
  - "the algorithm is appropriating the agora"

Modes of influence

  1. Hyper-targeted political advertising (Cambridge analytics)
  2. Curation alorithms (goole search, FB news feed)

# How the fragemented networks effect the necessary conditions of epistemic justifications of democracy

  - Condorcet Jury Theorems
    - echo chamber undermines the competence condition but not the independence if we ignore psych data 
    - if we accept that group think occurs, then it also undermines the independence claim
  - Epistemic Proceduralism
  - Deliberateive Democracy

  - how the echo chamber is bad
  - how the echo chamber is abused
