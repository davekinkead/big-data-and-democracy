* Starting point: Democracy made political discussion public, rather than the private discussions of tyranny and oligarchy.
* Big data analytics makes public discussions private again.
* Reach and scale.
* "We are now free to engage in political bullshit."

Public political discussion becomes important when those who are influenced by them have the power to act on them. 




# Political Communication and Discussion

The classical model of communication has four components: the communication source, the message communicated, the medium or channel used, and the receiver of the communication [@lilleber_key_2006, p. 17]. The medium may be speech, text printed in a book or pamphlet, sound, images, and video transmitted by mass media. The medium affects how many people can receive it.

We will call these attributes the message's *reach*.

A whispered conversation has a targeted, narrow audience: the source and receiver speak to each other face-to-face. A television broadcast potentially has an audience of millions. As this example suggests, different media have different levels of accessibility to citizens: anyone capable of hearing and speech can engage in a whispered discussion with another, but a television broadcast requires air-time on a television network. The cost of using the medium to communicate with the desired audience affects how accessible it is to a particular individual. 

Political discussion aims to convince others of the merits of a political goal. It becomes necessary when political actors (those with the means to implement or prevent political action) differ in their views and their compliance cannot be enforced through the threat or use of violence. 
It is a special kind of political communication because it is intended engage with its audience rather than just inform them. It is an invitation to act rather than just a statement of a political viewpoint. As a result, political discussion is directed towards those able to influence political action. It is political communication between political actors. If the actors in a political system are limited, these discussions may take place in private and do not need to be distributed outside of the ruling group.
Political discussion with the public is unnecessary in a dictatorship, as the public has no influence in the dictator's actions. Conversely, political discussion with the public is crucial for a democracy as the public may directly affect political decisions through voting in a referendum or indirectly through deciding between candidates for office in elections. In democracies, political discussion is public. The number of political actors who may participate in political discussion is the *reach* of that discussion. 

The political actors who may participate in a political discussion are that discussion's *reach*. It encompasses the political actors whose agreement contributes to achieving political goals. For political systems where only a minority have political power, the reach may be limited: dictators need to include their trusted advisors if they decisions can be imposed on others (if they need to be included at all). Similarly for aristocracies or oligarchies, the reach of political discussion only needs to enclose those whose views affect the likelihood of a political decision being put in place.

# The Development of Public Political Discussion

As the above suggests, public political discussion is an integral part of a democracy. The reach of public political discussion within democracies has changed as democracies themselves have changed, either through expanding the franchise to greater numbers of people or through new communication technologies. We will illustrate how the reach of public political discussion has developed over time with a quick historical overview of public political discussion. This description is intended to signpost changes in how political discussion has occurred rather than present a detailed historical account. The starting point for our brief tour through communication in democracies is the fledging democracy of ancient Athens.

## The Agora of Ancient Athens

The *agora* (marketplace) represents the public life of ancient Greece (and specially, than of Athens) [@habermas_structural_1989, p. 3]. Citizenship was restricted to free people whose parents themselves were Athenian citizens, and only men could vote and participate in political life [@aristotle_athenian_1984, L.42]. While many Athenian officials were chosen by lot, military officers, those in charge of the funds for the army and festivals, and the curator of the water supply were elected by the male citizens [@aristotle_athenian_1984, M.43]. The council of five hundred (all chosen by lot) would vote on the issues facing the city and on whether they had confidence in the office holders (@aristotle_athenian_1984, M.43].

This close connection between citizenship and political participation meant that political discussion was an integral part of Athenian life. Political discussion, therefore, was relevant to all the male citizenry of Athens as they all could potentially participate in political decision-making. The potential *reach* of political discussion was all the male citizens of Athens. As Athens was a city-state (although one that would gain and lose power across the Greek peninsula), the geographical reach of political discussion did not have to extend far beyond the city (if it had to at all). 

The face-to-face communication of the *agora* also allows speakers to discriminate between different audiences. You could shout and be heard by all, or you could whisper and be heard by one. A canny political speaker could therefore tailor his messages to suit different audiences. If the communication remains face-to-face, only by asking the speaker and the listener can others discover what the message was. Such messages are *ephemeral*, as the only evidence of what what said is the recollections of those involved. These recollections themselves may be changed for political purposes. If a written record is made of a political speech, the message becomes *static* as it has a concrete form that is accessible to others. Consider the famous speeches of the Athenian orator Demothenes as an example: the orations themselves are ephemeral, and his message is transmitted directly to his audience. Written records of these speeches, either made by Demosthenes himself or members of his audience, place the message in a static form that may be communicated to others. Static messages are more difficult to change to suit different audiences for political purposes. 

In *Gorgias* (454e), Plato distinguishes between persuasion that gives knowledge to the audience, and persuasion that convinces the audience without providing them knowledge. The first type of persuasion we will call reasoned discussion, as the discussion aims to demonstrate to the audience that if they accept a set of beliefs or facts about the world, they must logically accept the conclusion the speaker is arguing for. Political discussions of this nature revolve around debating the truth or falsity of the statements within the argument, and whether the conclusion (the political act being argued for) necessarily follows from the presented argument. Ideally, reasoned political discussion should allow those who disagree to understand each other's positions, to identify the specific points of disagreement between them, and whether agreement can be reached. Political discussions of this form open up political arguments to critique and examination.

The other form of persuasion does not inform the audience in the same way. In the *Gorgias*, Plato's Socrates presses the claim against the orator Gorgias that a good orator can be more persuasive to those without expert knowledge of a subject than an expert (459b). As a result, knowledge and persuasion can be separated by a skilled communicator. If the audience is not well educated about the subject under debate, they may be persuaded to accept a conclusion that does not depend on the truth of its statements or the logic of the arguments presented to convince its audience to support a political decision. What is important for this form of persuasion is that the audience accepts the conclusion, not that the argument is justified by the facts or logical structure. We will call this form of political persuasion *sophistry*.^[Our use of the term 'sophistry' does not fully reflect the term's use in ancient Athens, since it did necessarily carry the same pejorative connotations that it later acquired. Plato's works are quite hostile to sophistry, although in the *Sophist* (267b-c) he distinguishes what we call 'sophistry' into *sophistry* ("us[ing] short speeches in private conversation to force the person talking with him to contradict himself") and demagoguery (someone who "can maintain his insincerity in long speeches to a crowd"). As we are concerned with both types of political discussion, our account of sophistry incorporates Plato's description of the persuasive skills of the demagogue.]

While sophistry is effective, it carries the risk of being identified as a *sophist*. There is a reputational cost to employing sophistry for political ends: it may be effective now, but future attempts to persuade others may be undermined if the baseless claims and faulty logic used in the past are called out. If the audience recognises that particular speakers lack the appropriate knowledge, they will be more critical in accepting (or even listening to) their arguments in the future: it risks damaging the speaker's credibility. Using knowledge and reason for political persuasion does not have the same reputational risk as relying on persuasiveness rather than knowledge.^[Of course, we are assuming that people will revise their beliefs in light of new evidence and experience.] Credibility is hard to obtain and easy to lose, especially when political messages may be received by an unsympathetic audience. As a result, political communicators endeavour to protect their credibility so that future messages are not undermined. This need to maintain credibility constrains the political messages a speaker will communicate. However, there may be opportunities to subvert this constraint by either restricting their messages to friendly and uncritical audiences or by obscuring them so that messages have different meanings to different audiences (i.e., 'dogwhistling').

* Agora
** Political discussion is public.
** Political discussion is primarily face-to-face, either individually or in groups.
** Political discussion occurs within a limited geographical area.
** Sophistry is possible, but carries a reputational cost.
** "No reputational cost in being reasonable."


## *Common Sense* and the Federalist Papers

Democracy next appears in North America, as the British colonies there declared independence in 1776 and then successfully rebelled against Great Britain. After the rebellion, the colonies begin to grapple with the problem of how their new nation should be governed. Public political discussion played a crucial role in encouraging and maintaining popular support for the rebellion. Both of these events featured political documents that influenced the public debate about both the rebellion and support for the proposed Constitution: *Common Sense* by Thomas Paine and the Federalist papers by 'Publius' (a pseudonym shared by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay), respectively. These works demonstrate features of political discussion that were promoted by developments in technology: the widespread distribution and accessibility of political argument across a broad geographical area (as demonstrated by *Common Sense*) and detailed public political debates in a static form (as demonstrated by the Federalist papers).

*Common Sense* first appeared in Philadelphia in 1776 as a pamphlet and forcefully presented arguments that the British crown was abusing its power over the American colonies and that the colonies should be independent of Britain.

The increasing accessibility of the printing press made it easier for a larger group of people to widely distribute political messages. A wider range of politically active citizens, outside of the state itself and the wealthy, could now distribute messages to geographically dispersed audiences.

As it was a printed document, *Common Sense* was a political message in a static form. It was accessible to anyone able to acquire a copy of it, and it would present the same message to any audience. It was also widely distributed across a wide geographical region.
Paine's political message had considerable reach.

The historical ideal of this is the Federalist papers, a collection of articles appearing in various New York newspapers that presented detailed arguments in support of the proposed Constitution for the future United States.
 
The Federalist Papers has its counterpart in the Anti-Federalist, which demonstrates the possibilities of this form of political discussion. Pamphlets and newspapers may serve as bidirectional communication, as others can respond to political messages in the same medium. If a citizen disagrees with a political view, she may respond with a political message of her own in the same medium and context. Interpersonal communication, such as that in the Athenian agora is bidirectional, but it is limited in its reach as the individuals involved must be a physical proximity to their audience. The bidirectional communication printing made possible allowed for political discussion to take place across larger geographical areas, involve a larger number of people, and occur in front of a greater audience.

Neither the Federalists or the Anti-Federalists could tailor their messages to suit particular audiences: their arguments were available to all who could read the newspapers that printed them. 
As the Anti-Federalist demonstrates, the arguments were visible to political opponents who could respond in kind. 

* Federalist
** Political discussion is public.
** Political discussion is both face-to-face, either individually or in groups, and via newspapers and pamphlets.
** Political discussion can occur over a larger geographical area.
** Define features of reach and discrimination. 
** Conception of the demos increases, message discrimination decreases.

## Mass Media

The messages broadcast via mass media have a reach unmatched by messages conveyed via earlier technologies. Radio, and later television, allowed governments and heads of state to address their entire population instantly. Franklin D. Roosevelt's 'fireside chats' on radio during his presidency are an iconic example of this new capability (@wu_master_2011, p. 76). These messages are broadcast to the population, making them accessible to all with the technology necessary to receive them. As a result, the audience of the message is the entire population, rather than a specific section of it. Messages conveyed via mass media are *broadcast* nature, where messages are received by those disinterested, neutral, or hostile to the message, as well as the intended audience [@lilleker_key_2006, pp. 46--48]. In contrast, messages conveyed to a group of people are *narrowcast* messages, as they are restricted to a specific intended audience. 

Mass media also made events in other countries and on foreign continents visible in a shorter timescale.

Mass media also marks the point where public political discussion in democracies started to become *unidirectional*: the audience of the message cannot respond with a similar message before the same audience. Unidirectional communication grants a degree of power to the speaker, as her audience do not have the same privilege to present their own message to both the source and to the other members of the audience in the same way. Similarly, those who operate mass media broadcast networks have power over their audience as they decide which speakers appear on their broadcasts and how they are presented. The costs of operating and maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate broadcast networks are considerably more than operating printing presses. 

Broadcast mass media is ephemeral to its audience unless it is recorded.

* Mass Media
** Political discussion is public.
** Political discussion is broadcast, with the audience being the entire nation.
** Cost increases.
** Trade-off between reach (geographic and numeric) and cost.
** Demos expands beyond the demos.
** Increased centralisation of power within states, and emerge of super-national governmental bodies.
** Cost increases. Communication becomes unidirectional.

## The Promise of the Internet

The Internet was also promoted as an egalitarian tool for political communication. 

* Utopian Internet (Barlow/Rheingold)
** Political discussion is public.
** Political discussion is possible between anyone nationally and internationally.
** Maximal reach (geographical and numerical), bidirectional communication at minimal cost.
** Message discrimination remains difficult.


# Social Media and Big Data


Targeted messaging creates the possibility of wide-ranging narrowcast messaging. Such messages are still static, however. The combination of big data analytics and social media communication creates the new possibility of ephemeral narrowcast messaging. These messages are narrowcast because they are received only by selected citizens, who have been selected due to their susceptability to these messages (as indicated through profiling via big data analytics). Crucially, it also allows these messages to be ephemeral, as conveying the message via social media means it is hidden from other citizens unless a recipient chooses to reveal it to others. As Lilleker [-@lilleker_key_2006, p. 48] rightly observes, narrowcast messages are insecure in that they may still be received by those outside of the targeted audience, or it may be passed onto and reported by the media.^[Lilleker [-@lilleker_key_2006, p. 48] illustrates this point with the example of the Canadian Liberal Party sending cards to different groups of voters that contained opposing campaign pledges.]

** Political discussion is private.
** Specialised audiences can be identified and targeted with political discussion that is tailored to provoke a particular response.
** Decouples message discrimination from reach.
"Reduced the cost of being unreasonable."


# Epistemic Justifications for Democracy



# The Network is the Demos

The citizenry of a democracy, the *demos*, communicate with each other to persuade others to accept their political views. The *demos* may be represented as a communication network, where the nodes represent citizens and the connections between nodes represent the means by which citizens communicate with each other. Each citizen has a 'state' representing their voting intention(s). The outcome of a democratic poll is determined by counting the voting intentions of each node and following the decision-making procedure adopted by the *demos*, such as majority voting, preferences, and so on. Political communication, therefore, is the attempt to convince citizens to either change or maintain their voting intention.

This communication between citizens may be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. One-to-one political persuasion is two citizens discussing politics to persuade each other of the merits of their individual views. One-to-many communication occurs when one citizen presents her political views to an audience. While the audience may be able to respond to the communicating citizen (even if it is only by heckling), the communicator has a platform differentiating her from her audience. Many-to-many communication allows citizens to communicate as equals with an audience of their fellow citizens.


 

The development of broadcast mass media, radio and television, allows messages to be conveyed to large numbers of people instantaneously. 





# Targeting Political Messages

As our quick overview of the different forms of political communication through history suggests, the media available to convey messages affects the number and distribution of citizens who may receive it.



> The remaining sections are early notes and the original outline.






Attributes of communication networks

  - asymmetry of power
  - cost of production
  - 1 to 1, vs 1 to many, many to many, (few to few)
  - geographical reach
  - discrimination of message
  _ ephemeral/static


The Historical Account

  - history of democracy from the perspective of media networks
  - Athenians (agora, symmetric active & passive participation, local demos)
  - federalists (newspaper, asymmetric favouring active participants, regional demos)
  - 1920's (radio, more asymemetric to active, national demos)
  - mass media (tv, huge asymmetry to active, very broad demos)


# Individualised Media fragments the Demos

Demonstrate how new media fragments traditional mass media networks
^[DD: Need to define media fragments: perhaps 'news presented devoid of context and quality signifiers'?]

  - how does the internet fragment our comms networks?
  - distinction between following blogs/producers & SM news feed
  - individualised media (internet, massive centralisation, decoupling of message discrimination)
  - how much of our attention is drawn to walled gardens
  - cf mass media ownership laws
  - individual responses in SM are not public in the traditional sense (the appropriation of public comms space)
  - "the algorithm is appropriating the agora"
