Public political discussion becomes important when those who are influenced by them have the power to act on them. 




# Political Communication and Discussion

The classical model of communication has four components: the communication source, the message communicated, the medium or channel used, and the receiver of the communication [@lilleber_key_2006, p. 17]. The medium may be speech, text printed in a book or pamphlet, sound, images, and video transmitted by mass media. The medium affects how many people can receive it.

We will call these attributes the commmunication's *reach*.

A whispered conversation has a targeted, narrow audience: the source and receiver speak to each other face-to-face. A television broadcast potentially has an audience of millions. As this example suggests, different media have different levels of accessibility to citizens: anyone capable of hearing and speech can engage in a whispered discussion with another, but a television broadcast requires air-time on a television network. The cost of using the medium to communicate with the desired audience affects how accessible it is to a particular individual. 

Political discussion aims to convince others of the merits of a political goal. It becomes necessary when political actors (those with the means to implement or prevent political action) differ in their views and their compliance cannot be enforced through the threat or use of violence. 
It is a special kind of political communication because it is intended engage with its audience rather than just inform them. It is an invitation to act rather than just a statement of a political viewpoint. As a result, political discussion is directed towards those able to influence political action. It is political communication between political actors. If the actors in a political system are limited, these discussions may take place in private and do not need to be distributed outside of the ruling group.
Political discussion with the public is unnecessary in a dictatorship, as the public has no influence in the dictator's actions. Conversely, political discussion with the public is crucial for a democracy as the public may directly affect political decisions through voting in a referendum or indirectly through deciding between candidates for office in elections. In democracies, political discussion is public. The number of political actors who may participate in political discussion is the *reach* of that discussion. 

The political actors who may participate in a political discussion are that discussion's *reach*. It encompasses the political actors whose agreement contributes to achieving political goals. For political systems where only a minority have political power, the reach may be limited: dictators need to include their trusted advisors if they decisions can be imposed on others (if they need to be included at all). Similarly for aristocracies or oligarchies, the reach of political discussion only needs to enclose those whose views affect the likelihood of a political decision being put in place.

# The Agora: Beginnings of Public Political Discussion

As the above suggests, public political discussion is an integral part of a democracy. The reach of public political discussion within democracies has changed as democracies themselves have changed, either through expanding the franchise to greater numbers of people or through new communication technologies. We will illustrate how the reach of public political discussion has developed over time with a quick historical overview of public political discussion. This description is intended to signpost changes in how political discussion has occurred rather than present a detailed historical account. The starting point for our brief tour through communication in democracies is the fledging democracy of ancient Athens. 

The *agora* (marketplace) represents the public life of ancient Greece (and specially, than of Athens) [@habermas_structural_1989, p. 3]. Citizenship was restricted to free people whose parents themselves were Athenian citizens, and only men could vote and participate in political life [@aristotle_athenian_1984, L.42]. While many Athenian officials were chosen by lot, military officers, those in charge of the funds for the army and festivals, and the curator of the water supply were elected by the male citizens [@aristotle_athenian_1984, M.43]. The council of five hundred (all chosen by lot) would vote on the issues facing the city and on whether they had confidence in the office holders (@aristotle_athenian_1984, M.43].

This close connection between citizenship and political participation meant that political discussion was an integral part of Athenian life. Political discussion, therefore, was relevant to all the male citizenry of Athens as they all could potentially participate in political decision-making. The potential *reach* of political discussion was all the male citizens of Athens. As Athens was a city-state (although one that would gain and lose power across the Greek peninsula), the geographical reach of political discussion did not have to extend far beyond the city (if it had to at all). 

The face-to-face communication of the *agora* also allows speakers to discriminate between different audiences. You could shout and be heard by all, or you could whisper and be heard by one. A canny political speaker could therefore tailor his messages to suit different audiences. If the communication remains face-to-face, only by asking the speaker and the listener can others discover what the message was. Such messages are *ephemeral*, as the only evidence of what what said is the recollections of those involved. These recollections themselves may be changed for political purposes. If a written record is made of a political speech, the message becomes *static* as it has a concrete form that is accessible to others. Consider the speeches of Demothenes as an example: the orations themselves are ephemeral, and his message is transmitted directly to his audience. Written records of these speeches, either made by Demosthenes himself or members of his audience, place the message in a static form that may be communicated to others. Static messages are more difficult to change to suit different audiences for political purposes. 

The philosophers of ancient Athens also give us accounts of two forms of political discussion: reasoned discussion and sophistry. Reasoned political discussion moves from accepted premises towards a conclusion that supports a political action. It therefore places much significance on the truth of the premises used to support the conclusion and whether the conclusion necessarily follows from these premises. If any of the premises are rejected, there is no obligation to accept the conclusion. Reasoned discussion allows for political debate to occur through challenging and defending both the premises of the argument, and the connection between the premises and the conclusion. Ideally, reasoned political discussion should allow those who disagree to understand each other's positions. Ideally, reasoned political discussion allows those who disagree to understand the specific points of disagreement between them and whether agreement can be reached. It opens up political argument to examination and critique, so that the political decisions resulting from it can be defended.

Sophistry uses tools of persuasion other than defensible argument to encourage political support. 

While sophistry is effective, it carries the risk of being identified as a *sophist*. There is a reputational risk to employing sophistry for political ends: it may be effective now, but future attempts to persuade others may be undermined if the baseless claims and faulty logic used in the past are called out. Using reason for political persuasion does not have the same reputational risk. 

 

* Agora
** Political discussion is public.
** Political discussion is primarily face-to-face, either individually or in groups.
** Political discussion occurs within a limited geographical area.
** Sophistry is possible, but carries a reputational cost.
** "No reputational cost in being reasonable."


# The Federalist Papers

Democracy next appears in North America, as the colonies who successfully rebelled against Great Britain begin to grapple with the problem of how their new nation should be governed. Public political discussion played a crucial role in encouraging and maintaining popular support for the rebellion. 

 The historical ideal of this is the Federalist papers, a collection of articles appearing in various New York newspapers in support of the proposed Constitution for the future United States.
 
The Federalist Papers has its counterpart in the Anti-Federalist, which demonstrates the possibilities of this form of political discussion. 

Neither the Federalists or the Anti-Federalists could tailor their messages to suit particular audiences: their arguments were available to all who could read the newspapers that printed them. 
As the Anti-Federalist demonstrates, the arguments were visible to political opponents who could respond in kind. 

* Federalist
** Political discussion is public.
** Political discussion is both face-to-face, either individually or in groups, and via newspapers and pamphlets.
** Political discussion can occur over a larger geographical area.
** Define features of reach and discrimination. 
** Conception of the demos increases, message discrimination decreases.

# Mass Media

Events in other countries and on foreign continents becomes visible in a shorter timescale.


* Mass Media
** Political discussion is public.
** Political discussion is broadcast, with the audience being the entire nation.
** Cost increases.
** Trade-off between reach (geographic and numeric) and cost.
** Demos expands beyond the demos.
** Increased centralisation of power within states, and emerge of super-national governmental bodies.
** Cost increases. Communication becomes unidirectional.

# The Promise of the Internet


* Utopian Internet (Barlow/Rheingold)
** Political discussion is public.
** Political discussion is possible between anyone nationally and internationally.
** Maximal reach (geographical and numerical), bidirectional communication at minimal cost.
** Message discrimination remains difficult.

# Social Media and Big Data

** Political discussion is private.
** Specialised audiences can be identified and targeted with political discussion that is tailored to provoke a particular response.
** Decouples message discrimination from reach.
"Reduced the cost of being unreasonable."


# Epistemic Justifications for Democracy



Political persuasion occurs via various means. Discounting violence and the threat of force, political views may persuade through defensible reasoning, their coherence with previously-held beliefs and knowledge about the world, or by appeals to emotions and biases, or through the charisma and reputation of their proponents. While the ideal of democratic decision making is that citizens' decisions are based on evidence-based reasoning, the reality is that factors such the charisma of those promoting political views or appeals to emotion and biases are as great (if not greater) factors in how the *demos* makes decisions.

Our account is based on representing a democratic political community, or *demos*, as a communication network, where enfranchised members (citizens) can affect political decisions through voting. 

# Communication Between Citizens



The medium also affects whether messages are *static* or *ephemeral*. Static messages remain accessible after they are communicated, allowing both the original receiver and others to review the message's content at any time. Ephemeral messages are not recorded after they are expressed: they exist only in the memories of the source and receiver. As a result, there is the opportunity to deny or revise the message's content if challenged. Static messages remain the same as long as the recording medium it exists, although the message's context may change. The sources and receivers of ephemeral messages may record them in a static form so that it may inform or persuade those outside of the message's original audience. 

Communication media also differ in the size of the audience they can reach and whether they can be restricted to specific audiences. A whispered conversation is only received by the individuals hearing it. It is interpersonal communication. The speakers in this situation have a clear intended audience for their message: it is not meant for everyone, and anyone out of earshot will be unaware of what was said. In contrast, television broadcasts are available to all who have a television. A interpersonal communication may be called a *narrowcast* message, as it is restricted to a specific intended audience. This is in contrast with the *broadcast* nature of mass media, where messages are received by those disinterested, neutral, or hostile to the message, as well as the intended audience [@lilleker_key_2006, pp. 46--48].

The context of messages is how those who receive and send understand the circumstances in which it occurs, including what kind of message is being communicated. For political messages, the context includes the history of the society, current political and social issues, and the social norms governing behaviour. Understanding the context of a message allows citizens to recognise when political communication is taking place, and that the messages they send and receive should be understood as attempts to persuade others of a given political view. Political communicators recognise the importance of context, and often attempt to convey their messages in unfamiliar contexts so that the audience does not evaluate the message as a political communication. Regulations requiring the source of political messages to clearly identify themselves are another acknowledgement of this importance.^[One response to this claim that is *all* communication is political in that it implicitly reinforces particular norms or a particular ideology. If this is the case, our network account of the *demos* will not be a useful abstraction as political persuasion is not a discreet event that can be isolated from nonpolitical messages. However, the context is still relevant even if all messages contain a political element: overt political messages are still recognisable as such. Implicit political communication in apparently non-political messages are just another context for political messaging to occur.] (As we will argue later, this ability to convey political messages via unexpected contexts is an important concern about using social media as a means of political communication.)

Another aspect of context is the communicator's credibility: the perception of the source's trustworthiness as a source of information and how likely their opinion is based on evidence and defensible reasoning. Credibility is hard to obtain and easy to lose, especially when political messages may be received by an unsympathetic audience. As a result, political communicators endeavour to protect their credibility so that future messages are not undermined. This need to maintain credibility is a constraint on the political messages that a citizen will communicate. Political communicators may accept this constraint and endeavour to use defensible reasoning and verifiable evidence in their messages. However, there may be opportunities to subvert this constraint by either restricting their messages to a friendly and uncritical audience or obscuring them so that messages have different meanings to different audiences (i.e., 'dogwhistling').

Communication between citizens takes time and effort, especially if they are separated by distance. Physical distance may make it impossible for some citizens to convey messages in particular forms: interpersonal communication requires physical proximity unless video conferencing and telecommunications are used, for instance. As this suggests, technology may reduce the difficulties of communicating with other citizens. However, the use of technology has a medium for communicating introduces additional factors that may influence the content, form, and context of messages. These messages are hence technologically *mediated*.^[This is an expansion of the concept of 'computer-mediated communication' (CMC). It might also be considered a subset of mediation theory, where the characteristics of technology affect the possible moral decisions that an agent must make.]

The technology used to communicate and the context in which communication occurs define whether it is *unidirectional* or *bidirectional*. Unidirectional connections mean that the receiver(s) of the message cannot respond with a similar message in the same context. Think of a speaker at a political rally: the crowd may respond with cheers or jeers, but the individuals in the crowd lack the privileges granted by standing on the podium and expressing their views to the audience. The crowd cannot engage in an equal political discussion with the speaker in this context. Unidirectional communication therefore grants a degree of power to the source, as members of her audience (as individuals) do not have the same privilege to present their message to both the source and to the other members of the audience in the same way.

In contrast, bidirectional communication occurs when citizens can respond to the message in the same context and medium. If a citizen disagrees with a political view, she may respond with a political message of her own in the same medium and context. Interpersonal communication is bidirectional, while the characteristics of different forms of technologically mediated communication determine whether it is unidirectional or bidirectional. The form of technology used to communicate hence affects how political communication takes place and who is privileged over others in how their messages are distributed.


# The Network is the Demos

Our account emphasises the role technology plays in influencing the breadth of political communication that takes place. As technology changes and develops, the characteristics and possible audiences for political messages change as well. The role of technology in changing the possibilities for political communication may be illustrated through historical examples that range of no technological mediation (one-to-one) to completely technologically mediated (one-to-chosen few). Our network model of a democratic community illustrates these differences in the breadth of political communication.

The citizenry of a democracy, the *demos*, communicate with each other to persuade others to accept their political views. The *demos* may be represented as a communication network, where the nodes represent citizens and the connections between nodes represent the means by which citizens communicate with each other. Each citizen has a 'state' representing their voting intention(s). The outcome of a democratic poll is determined by counting the voting intentions of each node and following the decision-making procedure adopted by the *demos*, such as majority voting, preferences, and so on. Political communication, therefore, is the attempt to convince citizens to either change or maintain their voting intention.

Consider a basic example of such a network, containing three equal citizens: Alice, Bob, and Carol. Each of them has the choice between two options in a vote (options 1 and 2). Alice and Bob are proponents for options 1 and 2, respectively. Their voting states are therefore 1 (Alice) and 2 (Bob). Carol is undecided between 1 and 2, and has no preference between them: her voting state is 0. As the vote is tied, Alice and Bob both communicate with Carol to convince her to vote for their preferred option. If Alice's message in favour of option 1 convinces Carol, her voting state changes from 0 to 1. Similarly, if Bob is convincing is his message to Carol in favour of option 2, Carol's voting state will change to 0.

This example assumes that Carol is equally receptive to both Alice and Bob's messages. Suppose that is more receptive to Alice's message than to Bob's: perhaps Carol recognises Alice's expertise in matters relating to options 1 and 2. Alice has more credibility as a source for political messages than Bob does. As a result, it is more difficult for Bob to convince Carol to change her voting state from 0 to 2 (and especially from 1 to 2). This willingness to allow messages from particular sources to affect the receiver's voting state is the *weight* given to a message by the receiver. It represents the effects of credibility, defensible reasoning, bias, and other factors that influence the reception of political messages. If the weight of messages from a particular source drops below a given threshold, the messages are ignored by the receiver (i.e., they do not affect her decisions).

Crucially, messages can affect the weight given by the receiver of future messages, either by the original source or from other sources. A message that demonstrates the source's credibility (perhaps corroboration with independent sources and evidence) may increase the weight given to both that message in retrospect and to future messages from that source. A message that demonstrates the source's lack of credibility will reduce the weight given to that source's messages. Importantly, messages may relate to the credibility of messages *given by other sources*. If Alice sends a compelling message to Carol that messages from Bob lack credibility, the weight of Bob's messages in influencing Carol's voting state is reduced if Carol accepts Alice's message. Political messages therefore affect the voting state of a citizen, and the weight given by citizens towards messages from sources.

Rightly or wrongly, not all the individuals in a political community are necessarily able to influence the decision-making procedure through voting. While these individuals may be invisible in the decision-making procedure, they may still have an influence in the outcome of democratic decision-making. These disenfranchised community members may also be represented in the network as nodes since they can communicate with citizens to persuade them to adopt political views that are in their interests. Those unable to vote may be considered hidden nodes in the network, as their voting intention is not incorporated into the decision-making procedure of the *demos*.^[Crucially, those outside of the *demos* may communicate with citizens to persuade them how to vote or to influence the weight they give to messages from other sources.]

The connections between nodes take different forms, depending on the communication medium and the context in which communication occurs. These connections are distinguished by how the communication is mediated through technology. Direct interpersonal (face-to-face) communication has no technological mediation, while newspapers convey messages via the medium of print. These media define how messages are sent to other nodes, and the weight given by receivers of those messages. Certain forms of media may have more credibility as sources for political messages than others, due to the receiver's perception of both the message source and whoever controls the medium used to send it. For example, different newspapers have different editorial standards and perspectives about what is newsworthy. The receiver's perception of a newspaper's standards and perspectives will affect the weight she gives to information she receives from that source, and even whether she ignores it as a source altogether.

While each citizen is an equal node in the network (in the sense that their vote is no more or less important than any other citizen), wealthy citizens are able to communicate with many more other citizens than poorer ones as they have access to a great range of communication media. The wealthy are, quite literally, better connected than their less fortunate peers. If they own or control sources across various different forms of media, a wealthy citizen may send political messages to citizens via those media, which increases the exposure of other citizens to her messages. They may even use one media to influence the weight receivers give to other media: one newspaper may attempt to undermine the credibility of another, for instance. If the receivers are unaware that there is a common or sympathetic source between political messages received from different media (or via different sources), the receivers' perception of the credibility of those messages may be different than if she was aware of this connection.


# Communication within the Demos

This communication between citizens may be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. One-to-one political persuasion is two citizens discussing politics to persuade each other of the merits of their individual views. One-to-many communication occurs when one citizen presents her political views to an audience. While the audience may be able to respond to the communicating citizen (even if it is only by heckling), the communicator has a platform differentiating her from her audience. Many-to-many communication allows citizens to communicate as equals with an audience of their fellow citizens.

Communication Type                  Historical Example
------------------                  ------------------
One-to-One/Few (Interpersonal)      Athenian Agora
One-to-Some                         Federalist Papers
One-to-Many                         Mass Media
Many-to-Many                        Utopian Internet


The most basic form of political communication is interpersonal discussion, which requires no additional technology to mediate it and only requires the willingness of each citizen to engage in political debate. This includes both the one-to-one communication of two people having a political discussion and the one-to-few communication of someone presenting her views to a group. The historical ideal of this is the *agora* (marketplace) of ancient democratic Athens. Citizenship in ancient Athens was of course highly restricted, so that the majority of the city's population would be hidden nodes in the communication network.

The increasing accessibility of the printing press made it easier for a larger group of people to widely distribute political messages. A wider range of politically active citizens, outside of the state itself and the wealthy, could now distribute messages to geographically dispersed audiences.  

The development of broadcast mass media, radio and television, allows messages to be conveyed to large numbers of people instanteously. Broadcast mass media is ephemeral to its audience unless it is recorded.

The Internet was also promoted as an egalitarian tool for political communication. 



# Targeting Political Messages

As our quick overview of the different forms of political communication through history suggests, the media available to convey messages affects the number and distribution of citizens who may receive it.

Targeted messaging creates the possibility of wide-ranging narrowcast messaging. Such messages are still static, however. The combination of big data analytics and social media communication creates the new possibility of ephemeral narrowcast messaging. These messages are narrowcast because they are received only by selected citizens, who have been selected due to their susceptability to these messages (as indicated through profiling via big data analytics). Crucially, it also allows these messages to be ephemeral, as conveying the message via social media means it is hidden from other citizens unless a recipient chooses to reveal it to others. As Lilleker [-@lilleker_key_2006, p. 48] rightly observes, narrowcast messages are insecure in that they may still be received by those outside of the targeted audience, or it may be passed onto and reported by the media.^[Lilleker [-@lilleker_key_2006, p. 48] illustrates this point with the example of the Canadian Liberal Party sending cards to different groups of voters that contained opposing campaign pledges.]
