# The Network is the Demos

Citizens in a democracy interact with each other to influence political decisions, either directly through political action, or indirectly through supporting and voting for candidates to act for them in a representative assembly. The citizenry of a democracy, the *demos*, are able to communicate to persuade other citizens of the value of their political views. This communication between citizens may be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. One-to-one political persuasion is two citizens discussing politics to persuade each other of the merits of their individual views. One-to-many communication occurs when one citizen presents her political views to an audience. While the audience may be able to respond to the communicating citizen (even if it is only by heckling), the communicator has a platform differentiating her from her audience. Many-to-many communication allows citizens to communicate as equals with an audience of their fellow citizens.

Political persuasion has several axes. Discounting violence and the threat of force, political views may presuade through charisma, persuasive and defensible reasoning, and by appealing to emotions and biases. While the ideal of democratic decision making is that citizens' decisions are based on evidence-based reasoning, the reality is that irrational factors such as the charisma of those promoting political views or appeals to emotion and biases are as great (if not greater) factors in how the *demos* makes decisions.

Some citizens have greater reach across the *demos* in propagating their views. 


Attributes of communication networks

  - asymmetry of power
  - cost of production
  - 1 to 1, vs 1 to many, many to many, (few to few)
  - geographical reach
  - discrimination of message


The relationship between political communication and democracy can be illustrated via a brief sketch of several historical phases in democratic societies: the Athenian Agora of the Periclean golden age, the newspaper distribution of the Federalist Papers during the American Constitutional Convention, the mass media of the 20th century, and the early Internet.


The Historical Account

  - history of democracy from the perspective of media networks
  - Athenians (agora, symmetric active & passive participation, local demos)
  - federalists (newspaper, asymmetric favouring active participants, regional demos)
  - 1920's (radio, more asymemetric to active, national demos)
  - mass media (tv, huge asymmetry to active, very broad demos)


# Individualised Media fragments the Demos

Demonstrate how new media fragments traditional mass media networks
^[DD: Need to define media fragments: perhaps 'news presented devoid of context and quality signifiers'?]

  - how does the internet fragment our comms networks?
  - distinction between following blogs/producers & SM news feed
  - individualised media (internet, massive centralisation, decoupling of message discrimination)
  - how much of our attention is drawn to walled gardens
  - cf mass media ownership laws
  - individual responses in SM are not public in the traditional sense (the appropriation of public comms space)
  - "the algorithm is appropriating the agora"


# How the fragemented networks effect the necessary conditions of epistemic justifications of democracy


Modes of influence

  1. Hyper-targeted political advertising (Cambridge Analytics)
  2. Curation algorithms (Google search, FB news feed)

  - Condorcet Jury Theorems
    - echo chamber undermines the competence condition but not the independence if we ignore psych data 
    - if we accept that group think occurs, then it also undermines the independence claim
  - Epistemic Proceduralism
  - Deliberative Democracy

  - how the echo chamber is bad
  - how the echo chamber is abused
