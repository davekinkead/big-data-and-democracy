# The Network is the Demos

The citizenry of a democracy, the *demos*, communicate with each other to persuade others to accept their political views. The *demos* may be represented as a communication network, where the nodes represent citizens and the connections between nodes represent the means by which citizens communicate with each other. These connections take different forms, depending on the communication medium and the context in which communication occurs. The communication medium is the form that instantiates a political message, such as speech, text printed in a pamphlet or book, sound, images, and video transmitted by mass media. The context is how the citizens understand the situation in which political communication occurs. It allows them to recognise that political communication is taking place, and that the messages they send and receive should be understood as attempts to persuade others to accept a political view. Political communicators recognise the importance of context, and often attempt to convey their messages in unfamiliar contexts so that the audience does not evaluate the message as a political communication. Regulations requiring the communicators behind a political message to clearly identify themselves are another acknowledgement of this importance.^[One response to this claim that is *all* communication is political in that it implicitly reinforces particular norms or a particular ideology. If this is the case, our network account of the *demos* will not be a useful abstraction as political persuasion is not a discreet event that can be isolated from nonpolitical messages. However, the context is still relevant even if all messages contain a political element: overt political messages are still recognisable as such. Implicit political communication in apparently non-political messages are just another context for political messaging to occur.] (As we will argue later, this ability to convey political messages via unexpected contexts is an important concern about the use of social media as a means of political communication.)

The communication medium and context often define whether communication between citizens is *unidirectional* or *bidirectional*. Unidirectional connections mean that the receiver(s) of the message cannot respond with a similar message in the same context. Think of a speaker at a political rally: the crowd may respond with cheers or jeers, but the individuals in the crowd lack the privileges granted by standing on the podium and expressing their views to the audience. The crowd cannot engage in an equal political discussion with the speaker in this context. In contrast, bidirectional communication occurs between citizens when they can respond to the messages in the same context. If a citizen disagrees with the political view expressed by another, she can challenge him by responding with a political message of her own in the same medium and context. 

Communication between citizens takes time and effort, especially if they are separated by distance. Physical distance may make it impossible for some citizens to convey messages in particular forms: face-to-face, one-to-one communication requires physical proximity unless video conferencing and telecommunications are used. As this suggests, technology may reduce the difficulties of communicating with other citizens. 

The medium used to communicate with other citizens affects how quickly a message is conveyed and to how many people can receive it. Part of this is the cost of using the medium to communicate with the desired audience.

While each citizen is an equal node in the network (in the sense that their vote is no more or less important than any other citizen), wealthy citizens are able to communicate with many more other citizens than poorer citizens. The wealthy are, quite literally, better connected than their less fortunate peers.

Our account emphasises the role technology plays in influencing the breadth of political communication that takes place. As technology changes and develops, the characteristics and possible audiences for political messages change as well. The role of technology in changing the possibilities for political communication may be illustrated through historical examples that range of no technological mediation (one-to-one) to completely technologically mediated (one-to-chosen few).
  

## One-to-One: The Agora

The most basic form of political communication is a face-to-face discussion, which requires no additional technology to achieve and only requires the willingness of each citizen to engage in political debate.

Transient messages are not recorded after they are expressed: they exist only the memories of those who hear or say it. It is up to those involved these messages to record them in a static form if it is to persuade others who are not present at the time the message is conveyed. As a result, there is the opportunity to deny or revise the message's content if challenged. 


## One-to-Many: Newsprint and Pamphleteering

Written and printed messages 

## Instant One-to-Many: Mass Media

The development of broadcast mass media, radio and television, allows messages to be conveyed to large numbers of people instanteously. 

## Many-to-Many: The Utopian Internet

# One-to-the-Chosen Few: Big Data in the Demos



# Political Persuasion through Communication

Political communication is intended to cause political action. 

Citizens in a democracy interact with each other to influence political decisions, either directly through political action, or indirectly through supporting and voting for candidates to act for them in a representative assembly. 



# Political Messages in Communication Networks

Messages may also be *static* or *transient*. Static messages remain accessible after they are communicated, allowing both the intended recipent and others to review the message's content at any time. Transient messages are not recorded after they are expressed: they exist only the memories of those who hear or say it. As a result, there is the opportunity to deny or revise the message's content if challenged. Static messages will remain the same as long as the medium recording it exists: only the message's context may change. 



This communication may be a one-to-one or a small group discussion, where individuals debate their views with each other to encourage others to accept their views. 

The citizenry of a democracy, the *demos*, are able to communicate to persuade other citizens of the value of their political views. This communication between citizens may be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. One-to-one political persuasion is two citizens discussing politics to persuade each other of the merits of their individual views. One-to-many communication occurs when one citizen presents her political views to an audience. While the audience may be able to respond to the communicating citizen (even if it is only by heckling), the communicator has a platform differentiating her from her audience. Many-to-many communication allows citizens to communicate as equals with an audience of their fellow citizens.

Political persuasion has several axes. Discounting violence and the threat of force, political views may presuade through charisma, persuasive and defensible reasoning, and by appealing to emotions and biases. While the ideal of democratic decision making is that citizens' decisions are based on evidence-based reasoning, the reality is that irrational factors such as the charisma of those promoting political views or appeals to emotion and biases are as great (if not greater) factors in how the *demos* makes decisions.



Attributes of communication networks

  - asymmetry of power
  - cost of production
  - 1 to 1, vs 1 to many, many to many, (few to few)
  - geographical reach
  - discrimination of message
  _ transient/static


The relationship between political communication and democracy can be illustrated via a brief sketch of several historical phases in democratic societies: the Athenian Agora of the Periclean golden age, the newspaper distribution of the Federalist Papers during the American Constitutional Convention, the mass media of the 20th century, and the early Internet.


The Historical Account

  - history of democracy from the perspective of media networks
  - Athenians (agora, symmetric active & passive participation, local demos)
  - federalists (newspaper, asymmetric favouring active participants, regional demos)
  - 1920's (radio, more asymemetric to active, national demos)
  - mass media (tv, huge asymmetry to active, very broad demos)


# Individualised Media fragments the Demos

Demonstrate how new media fragments traditional mass media networks
^[DD: Need to define media fragments: perhaps 'news presented devoid of context and quality signifiers'?]

  - how does the internet fragment our comms networks?
  - distinction between following blogs/producers & SM news feed
  - individualised media (internet, massive centralisation, decoupling of message discrimination)
  - how much of our attention is drawn to walled gardens
  - cf mass media ownership laws
  - individual responses in SM are not public in the traditional sense (the appropriation of public comms space)
  - "the algorithm is appropriating the agora"


# How the fragemented networks effect the necessary conditions of epistemic justifications of democracy


Modes of influence

  1. Hyper-targeted political advertising (Cambridge Analytics)
  2. Curation algorithms (Google search, FB news feed)

  - Condorcet Jury Theorems
    - echo chamber undermines the competence condition but not the independence if we ignore psych data 
    - if we accept that group think occurs, then it also undermines the independence claim
  - Epistemic Proceduralism
  - Deliberative Democracy

  - how the echo chamber is bad
  - how the echo chamber is abused
