## Democracy and Demagoguery 

Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others we've tried from time to time (@churchill).  Like every political trope, this one resonates widely because it captures an essential element of truth - democracy, depsite its flaws, remains our most valuable political institution. 

People fight to realise and defend it with their lives.....add flourish....

Why it is so valuable and where exactly this value stems from motivates a considerable deal of work within political theory.  Sometimes, this value is said to come from the egalitarian nature of democratic rule (cite).  Othertimes, democracy is deemed valuable because of its correspondence with liberal ideals (cite), or ....

One popular theme in political theory however, is that democracy has _epistemic_ value.  Under this account, one source of democracy's value, and of the legitimacy of democratic governments, is that democratic process produce correct, knowledgeble, or at least informed answers to collective questions.  These epsitemic accounts can be quite diverse in nature, ranging from merely aggregative accounts like Condorcet's Jury Theorem, to the transformative accounts of deliberative democacy.  And whilst their specifics may vary considerably, their underlying claim remains similar - the outcomes of democratic processes are more likely to be correct than other collective or singular processes.

One such account is Condorcet's Jury Theorem.  First articulated by the Marquis de Condorcet in 17XX (cite) the theorem is an early formalisation of what has become known as the wisdom of the crowds (cite).  Since then, the theorem has been generalised over a varity of conditions (cite) and mathematically proves that under certain conditions (footnote), the likelihood a majority vote identifies the correct answer to a binary question approaches certainty as the number of voters increases.  In concrete terms, the theorem shows that even with just 1000 voters with an average individual chance of being correct of 51%, the majority vote will have a 99.9% chance of being correct.

Deliberative Democracy

All these accounts rely on political communication but more specifically, _reasoned_ political communication.



  - that value is constantly at risk

## The Network and the Demos


Desite the ever present risk to democracy, the communication network structures that make democratic discourse possible have also made democracies epistemically robust.

  - network structures impose a trade off between message reach and discrimination

Early democracies were realatively small affairs by modern standards.   Describe Athens ....

- method was oral
- location was the agora
- the reach of a political message was limited to the strength of one's voice
- propogation relied on others understanding and repeating
- distinguish between reason & rhetoric




## Big Data and Democracy

  - The internet has made democracy frigile
  - the net decouples reach and discrimination
  - we can now
