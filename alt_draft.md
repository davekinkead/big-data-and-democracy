## Democracy and Demagoguery 

Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others we've tried from time to time (@churchill).  Like every political trope, this one resonates widely because it captures an essential element of truth - democracy, depsite its flaws, remains our most valuable political institution. 

People fight to realise and defend it with their lives.....add flourish....

Why it is so valuable and where exactly this value stems from motivates a considerable deal of work within political theory.  Sometimes, this value is said to come from the egalitarian nature of democratic rule (cite).  Othertimes, democracy is deemed valuable because of its correspondence with liberal ideals (cite), or ....

One popular theme in political theory, however, is that democracy has _epistemic_ value.  Under this account, one source of democracy's value, and of the legitimacy of democratic governments, is that democratic processes produce correct, knowledgeble, or at least informed answers to collective questions.  These epsitemic accounts can be quite diverse in nature, ranging from merely aggregative accounts like Condorcet's Jury Theorem, to the transformative accounts of deliberative democacy.  And whilst their specifics may vary considerably, their underlying claim remains similar - the outcomes of democratic processes are more likely to be correct than other collective or singular processes.

One such account is Condorcet's Jury Theorem.  First articulated by the Marquis de Condorcet in 17XX (cite) the theorem is an early formalisation of what has become known as the wisdom of the crowds (cite).  Since then, the theorem has been generalised over a varity of conditions (cite) and mathematically proves that under certain conditions (footnote), the likelihood a majority vote identifies the correct answer to a binary question approaches certainty as the number of voters increases.  In concrete terms, the theorem shows that even with just 1000 voters with an average individual chance of being correct of 51%, the majority vote will have a 99.9% chance of being correct.

Deliberative Democracy

All these accounts rely on political communication but more specifically, _reasoned_ political communication.



  - that value is constantly at risk

## The Network and the Demos


Desite the ever present risk to democracy, the communication network structures that make democratic discourse possible have also made democracies epistemically robust.

  - network structures impose a trade off between message reach and discrimination

Early democracies were relatively small affairs by modern standards, both geographically and demographically.  Describe Athens ....

The *agora* (marketplace) represents the public life of ancient Greece (and specially, than of Athens) [@habermas_structural_1989, p. 3]. Citizenship was restricted to free people whose parents themselves were Athenian citizens, and only men could vote and participate in political life [@aristotle_athenian_1984, L.42].

The face-to-face communication of the *agora* also allows speakers to target different audiences. You could shout and be heard by all, or you could whisper and be heard by one. A canny political speaker may tailor his messages to suit different audiences. 

If the communication remains face-to-face, only by asking the speaker and the listener can others discover what the message was. Such messages are *ephemeral*, as the only evidence of the message's content is the recollection of those involved. These recollections themselves may be changed for political purposes. If a written record is made of a political speech, the message becomes *static* as it has a concrete form that is accessible to others. A static message also has a greater range than an ephemeral one, as it exists in a physical, accessible form that can be read, transported, and copied after the message was first sent. Consider the famous speeches of the Athenian orator Demosthenes as an example: the orations themselves are ephemeral, and his message is transmitted directly to his audience. Written records of these speeches, either made by Demosthenes himself or members of his audience, place the message in a static form that may be communicated to others, distant from the original speech in both time and space. The written accounts of these speeches have a greater range than the original speech itself. Static messages are more difficult to change to suit different audiences for political purposes.

In *Gorgias* (454e), Plato distinguishes between persuasion that gives knowledge to the audience, and persuasion that convinces the audience without providing them knowledge. The first type of persuasion we will call reasoned discussion, as the discussion aims to demonstrate to the audience that if they accept a set of beliefs or facts about the world, they must logically accept the conclusion the speaker is arguing for. Political discussions of this nature revolve around debating the truth or falsity of the statements within the argument, and whether the conclusion (the political act being argued for) necessarily follows from the presented argument. Ideally, reasoned political discussion should allow those who disagree to understand each other's positions, to identify the specific points of disagreement between them, and whether agreement can be reached. Political discussions of this form open up political arguments to critique and examination.

The other form of persuasion does not inform the audience in the same way. In the *Gorgias*, Plato's Socrates presses the claim against the orator Gorgias that a good orator can be more persuasive to those without expert knowledge of a subject than an expert (459b). As a result, a skilled communicator can be persuasive without necessarily being knowledgeable. If the audience is not well educated about the subject under debate, they may be persuaded to accept a conclusion that does not depend on the truth of its statements or the logic of the arguments presented to convince its audience to support a political decision. What is important for this form of persuasion is that the audience accepts the conclusion, not that the argument is justified by the facts or logical structure. 

In the *Sophist* (267b-c), Plato goes on to distinguish between *sophistry*, the acts of "us[ing] short speeches in private conversation to force the person talking with him to contradict himself", and the speeches of a demagogue, who "can maintain his insincerity in long speeches to a crowd".


Democracy next appears in North America, where the British colonies there declared independence in 1776 and then successfully rebelled against Great Britain. After the rebellion, the colonies begin to grapple with the problem of how their new nation should be governed. Public political discussion played a crucial role in determining how the colonies would govern themselves and under what terms they should be united. The Federalist Papers by 'Publius' (a pseudonym shared by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay) is an influential example from this period.

The Federalist Papers are significant for our discussion for two reasons: the depth and care with which they discuss political issues, and that they were part of a debate with an opposing view that was also in print. The Federalist Papers were a response to newspaper articles that supported rejecting the proposed Constitution (@kramnick_federalist_1987, p. 76).^[Proponents of the draft Constitution and the central federal government it would establish were known as Federalists; their opponents were hence Anti-Federalists [@kramnick_federalist_1987, p. 37].] This demonstrates the possibilities of this form of political discussion. Pamphlets and newspapers may serve as bidirectional communication, as individuals who disagree may respond with political messages of their own in the same medium. Interpersonal communication, such as that in the Athenian *agora*, is bidirectional, but its reach and range is limited as the individuals involved must be a physical proximity to their audience. The bidirectional communication printing made possible allowed for political discussion to take place across larger geographical areas, involve a larger number of people, and occur in front of a greater audience.

Unlike face-to-face communication, the political discussions of the Federalists or the Anti-Federalists could not be easily tailored to suit particular audiences: their arguments were available to all who could read the newspapers that printed them. As the Federalist Papers themselves demonstrate, the arguments were visible to political opponents who could respond in kind. While the use of pseudonyms in publishing static messages allows a degree of tailoring (since it allows an author to present different views under different names, to disguise their common source and without having to be consistent between them), in this case no such deception was intended: the views presented by Madison, Hamilton, and Jay as 'Publius' did not conflict with their public support for the Constitution. Pseudonyms or anonymity in presenting a political message may be used for rhetorical purposes (such as the reference to the Roman Republic that 'Publius' signaled [@kramnick_federalist_1987, p. 72].) or to prevent the message's reception being influenced by any bias (positive or negative) that may result from it being the work of a particular individual or group.



- method was oral
- location was the agora
- the reach of a political message was limited to the strength of one's voice
- propogation relied on others understanding and repeating
- distinguish between reason & rhetoric

4. The nature of communication networks keep democracy epistemically robust 

  - Habermas' democratic institutions as communication networks connecting private individuals (citizens) with collective identities (citizenship)
    - the public sphere is only public if we all participate (as consumers or producers)

  - A technological feature of traditional communication networks is the trade off between the reach of a message (geographically, audience) and content discrimination

  - Athenians (agora, symmetric active & passive participation, local demos)
    - choice between 1-1 private comms or public comms
    - ?? how is democracy corrupted here ?? plato?? 

  - Federalists (newspaper, asymmetric favouring active participants, regional demos)
    - increase range, increased cost, decreased 
    
  - Mad Men (mass media, tv, huge asymmetry to active, very broad demos)


## Big Data and Democracy

  - The internet has made democracy frigile
  - the net decouples reach and discrimination
  - we can now
