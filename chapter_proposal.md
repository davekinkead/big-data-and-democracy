Our proposed chapter will present an argument that the use of big data analytics for political micro-targeting and curated news conflicts with epistemic justifications for democratic decision-making. Condorcet's jury theorem shows that in group decision-making, if each group member has a better than random chance of making a correct choice, the group majority has a greater chance of being correct than any individual group member. Increasing the size of the group also increases the probability that the majority decision of the group will be correct. 

However, Condorcet's jury theorem requires each group member to be *independent*: her decisions are not influenced by those of any other member, and that each member is *competent* (i.e., has a greater than random chance of being correct in making a decision). We argue that the political micro-targetting and curated news made possible by big data analtyics undermines both of these assumptions. 

By analysing the individual's interactions with others and her reactions to political messages, big data analytics allow for the creation of 'echo chambers' around individuals by presenting them with news and information that reinforces their existing views. This reinforcement of existing views strengthen's the individual's confidence in their beliefs, regardless of any contrary evidence or differences of opinion that might lead her to revise her views. This risks the individual's *competence* by presenting her biased evidence without her necessarily knowing that the evidence is biased or how it has been manipulated.

Big data analytics also risks undermining the *independence* of individual decision-making. Individuals identified through big data analtyics as having similiar views may be presented with evidence that supports their existing views, while others may be presented with different evidence. As a result, there is the possibility that multiple individuals will be directed towards making the same decision by those using big data analytics to influence political decision-making.
