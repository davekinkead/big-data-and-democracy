# How the fragemented networks effect the necessary conditions of epistemic justifications of democracy


## Democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others we've tried from time to time.

1. Democracy has real epistemic value

  - it has value - fairness, justice, equality, knowledge
  - Democracy answers the question: when we need to make collective decisions but which decision is better?
  - these epistemic accounts of democracy can be purely aggregative (eg CJT, wisdom of the crowds) or transformative (eg Deliberative)
  - aggregative accounts rely on diverse perspective and reasoning processes (voter independence) to aggregate the marginal competence of large numbers of people into majority decisions that have a high likelihood of being correct. 
  - deliberative accounts rely on diverse persepective and reasoning processes to transform reasoned and authentic deliberation into broad consensus about superior outcomes.


2. This epistemic value is always at risk

  - self interest can lead to subversion of democracy for private ends
  - Democracy can be corrupted by demogogy, sophistry, and indifference
  - sophistry expliots the psychological disconnect between what people do believe and what people should believe
  - increasing voter turnout amongst protagnonistic voters
  - suppressing voter turnout amongst antagonistic voters
  - shifting voter preference amongst undecided voters
  - undermining confidence in the legitimacy of democratic outcomes


4. The Network and the Demos 

  - Democratic proceedures can be viewed as a socio-political response to problems of collective judgement.
  - All epistemic accounts of democracy presuppose some group of people who make up the democracy and a method of communication amongst them
  - across these networks, there was a trade off between how far a signal could reach and how much the content could be discriminated between individuals
  - whilst sophistry was possible, it came with a cost - reputational damage, backfire when called out
  - high discrimination communication permitted low cost sophistry but had limited reach
  - high reach communication had low discrimination meaning sophistry could only be general in nature.
  - high reach communication required more resources and could be regulated, increasing the cost of sophistry


  - athens: high discrimination, low reach, low production cost, low repuation cost
  - federalists: low discrimination

Big Data and Democracy

  - the confluence of big data & social media platforms has decoupled the link between communication reach and cost.



3. How: Psychology of sophistry

  - different groups of voters have differing psychological profiles
  - motivated reasoning
  - confirmation bias
  - substitution 



2. Methods of propoganda

  - hyper targeted attack ads
  - propaganda hidden as fake events from fake accounts (followed by users or promoted)
  - tweets of misinformation from fake supporting accounts attempting to suppress voters (save time, vote via twitter) 





# The Network is the Demos


Attributes of communication networks

  - democracy as communication
  - power and pursuasion (asymetry, production cost)
  - how we pursuade
  - message reach (1 to 1, vs 1 to many, many to many, few to few)
  - message discrimination (persistent vs ephemeral)
  - message direction
  - message source ??? (hidden via trolls)


The Historical Account

  - history of democracy from the perspective of media networks
  - Athenians (agora, symmetric active & passive participation, local demos)
  - federalists (newspaper, asymmetric favouring active participants, regional demos)
  - 1920's (radio, more asymemetric to active, national demos)
  - mass media (tv, huge asymmetry to active, very broad demos)


# Individualised Media fragements the Demos

Demonstrate how new media fragments traditional mass media networks
^[DD: Need to define media fragments: perhaps 'news presented devoid of context and quality signifiers'?]

  - how does the internet fragment our comms networks?
  - distinction between following blogs/producers & SM news feed
  - individualised media (internet, massive centralisation, decoupling of message discrimination)
  - how much of our attention is drawn to walled gardens
  - cf mass media ownership laws
  - individual responses in SM are not public in the traditional sense (the appropriation of public comms space)
  - "the algorithm is appropriating the agora"




  1. Hyper-targeted political advertising (Cambridge Analytics)
  2. Curation algorithms (Google search, FB news feed)

  - Condorcet Jury Theorems
    - echo chamber undermines the competence condition but not the independence if we ignore psych data 
    - if we accept that group think occurs, then it also undermines the independence claim
  - Epistemic Proceduralism
  - Deliberative Democracy

## Democracy and Demagoguery 

  - democracy has epistemic value
    - CJT
    - DD
  - that value is constantly at risk
    - plato's demogoguery
    - mechanism
      - emotion is substituted for reason
      - convert fears & anieties into voting behaviour 
    - limits
      - partisanship limits persuadability
      - can still limit or enhance predispositions

## The Network and the Demos

  - Network structures have traditionally made democracies epistemically robust
  - network structures impose a trade off between message reach and discrimination
    - as reach increases, discrimination and response decreases
    - Agora - shifting discourse from reason to rheotric requires appealing to specifics

    - we can influence more and more people, but our capacity to manipulate diminishes
    - Federalists - anonymity allows 
    - increased diversity increases epistemic value and makes manipulation harder


## Big Data and Democracy

  - The internet has made democracy frigile
  - the net decouples reach and discrimination
    - enables two way communication at scale (unidirection to bidirectional)
    - significantly increases the communication analytics able to be captured (ratings vs individual actions)
    - big data analytics allows the construction of accurate psychographic models for much of the population
    - ML can automatic the creation of content for particular effects



Facebook
  - has digitally enclosed the public forum (discourse is no longer public but now a web of private conversations)
  - the echo chamber effect lowers epistemic virtue by limiting

Twitter




"...thus, the computer generated scores can be more accurate than even the knowledge of very close friends and family members." -- p 15 GSR / SCL agreement 
- available only under FB's old T&C, no new apps like this exist

1. develop behavioural based personality model by linking facebook likes to big 5
2. test SCL campaing messages on subjects and measure neurological aurasal in the lab
3. depoly and measure on facebook

- adaptive/conditional survey tools for push polling (Kanto)
